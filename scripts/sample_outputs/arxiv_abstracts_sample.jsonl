In the case of a\nhydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes may\nresult in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. The aim of\nthis paper is to measure these variations. We have obtained observations of the\ntransit of GJ1214b in the r- and I-band with the INT, in the g, r, i and z\nbands with the 2.2 meter MPI\/ESO telescope, in the Ks-band with the NOT, and in\nthe Kc-band with the WHT. By comparing the transit depth between the the\ndifferent bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, the\natmosphere is investigated. We do not detect clearly significant variations in\nthe planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. Although the ratio at\nthe shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the other\nbands. The uncertainties in the Ks and Kc bands are large, due to systematic\nfeatures in the light curves. The tentative increase in the planet-to-star size\nratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in the\neffective planet-size due to Rayleigh scattering, which would require GJ1214b\nto have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. If true, then the atmosphere has to have\nboth clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, as\nwell as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in the\nnear- and mid-infrared. However, star spots, which are known to be present on\nthe hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations in\nplanet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .\nA hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared points\nsufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with a\nwater-dominated atmosphere.

A widely favoured BSM\ncandidate is Supersymmetry (SUSY), which postulates a superpartner for each\nStandard Model particle. The first part of this thesis describes a strategy for\nan early discovery of SUSY using the trilepton signature, with a focus on\ngravity-mediated SUSY breaking, mSUGRA. The discovery potential for SUSY for\nthe case where strongly interacting supersymmetric particles are very massive\nis critically investigated. A possible choice of triggers for L = 10-31cm-2s-1\nis suggested by optimising the event yield at intermediate and final selection\nstages. A novel method to measure the rate of leptons from heavy flavour decays\npassing isolation requirements by isolating tt events in data is outlined.\n  The task of the ATLAS silicon tracker is to track particles produced in\nproton-proton collisions in its centre, measuring their momenta and production\nvertices. The precise knowledge of the silicon tracker module positions and\ntheir orientation in space (alignment) down to some microns and fractions of a\nmiliradian in the critical coordinates is of vital importance for large parts\nof the ambitious ATLAS physics program. In the second part of the thesis, the\nalignment of the ATLAS silicon tracker using the Robust Alignment algorithm and\nparticle tracks is described. The algorithm is applied to align end-cap A of\nthe pixel detector using cosmic ray particle tracks recorded during its\non-surface commissioning in 2006. Finally, about 2M cosmic ray tracks collected\nby ATLAS in situ in autumn 2008 are utilised to provide a coherent alignment of\nthe entire silicon tracker with the Robust Alignment algorithm.\n"}

We obtained a new estimate of the\nspin period of the neutron star P=528.24 \\pm 0.01 s (corrected for the orbital\nmotion of the X-ray source): the source is still in the spin-up state, as since\n1988. The pulse profile is double peaked, although significant variations of\nthe relative intensity of the peaks with energy are present. The broad band\n(0.12-100 keV) out-of-eclipse spectrum is well described by an absorbed power\nlaw modified by a high energy cutoff at \\sim 16 keV (e-folding energy \\sim 10\nkeV) plus an iron emission line at \\sim 6.4 keV. A cyclotron line at \\sim 21\nkeV is present. The width of the line is consistent with thermal Doppler\nbroadening at the temperature of the exponential cutoff. We searched for the\npresence of the second harmonic, previously reported for this source. We found\nno evidence of lines at \\sim 42 keV, although an absorption feature at 51 keV\nseems to be present (at 99% confidence level). A soft excess, modelled by a\nblackbody with a temperature of \\sim 0.08 keV could be present, probably\nemitted by the matter at the magnetosphere. We also performed a spectral\nanalysis during the X-ray eclipse. The spectral evolution during the eclipse\ncan be well described by a progressive covering of the primary Comptonization\nspectrum that is scattered into the line of sight. During the deep eclipse this\nspectrum also softens, suggesting that the dust-scattered component becomes\nimportant. An alternative, more complex model, with an emission iron line and\nscattered components (as the one that has been used to fit the eclipse of\nCentaurus X-3), also gives a good fit of the deep-eclipse data.\n"}

While reactive\nprogramming is an active field of research, the implementation of reactive\nconcepts remains challenging. In particular, change detection represents a hard\nbut inevitable necessity when implementing reactive concepts. Typically, change\ndetection mechanisms are not intended for reuse but are tightly coupled to the\nparticular change resolution mechanism. As a result, developers often have to\nre-implement similar abstractions. A reusable primitive for change detection is\nstill missing. To find a suitable primitive, we identify commonalities in\nexisting reactive concepts. We discover a class of reactive concepts,\nstate-based reactive concepts. All state-based reactive concepts share a common\nchange detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an\nexpression. On the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism,\nwe propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the\ntedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease\nthe implementation of reactive programming concepts. We evaluate the design of\nactive expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive\nconcepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness\nof active expressions. Active expressions enable the separation of essential\nfrom non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts.

This model encapsulates many realistic features of translation\nincluding non-homogeneous transition rates along the mRNA, the fact that every\nribosome covers several codons, and the fact that ribosomes cannot overtake one\nanother.\n  The RFMEO is a mean-field approximation of an important model from\nstatistical mechanics called the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process\nwith extended objects (TASEPEO). We demonstrate that the RFMEO describes\nbiophysical aspects of translation better than previous mean-field\napproximations, and that its predictions correlate well with those of TASEPEO.\nHowever, unlike TASEPEO, the RFMEO is amenable to rigorous analysis using tools\nfrom systems and control theory. We show that the ribosome density profile\nalong the mRNA in the RFMEO converges to a unique steady-state density that\ndepends on the length of the mRNA, the transition rates along it, and the\nnumber of codons covered by every ribosome, but not on the initial density of\nribosomes along the mRNA. In particular, the protein production rate also\nconverges to a unique steady-state. Furthermore, if the transition rates along\nthe mRNA are periodic with a common period T then the ribosome density along\nthe mRNA and the protein production rate converge to a unique periodic pattern\nwith period T, that is, the model entrains to periodic excitations in the\ntransition rates.\n  We believe that the RFMEO could be useful for modeling, understanding, and\nre-engineering translation as well as other important biological processes.\n"}

Methods: To search for pulsations we used data\nof an observation of the source with XMM-Newton performed in timing mode. For\nthe spectral analysis, we used earlier XMM-Newton observations performed in\nimaging mode, which permits a more accurate treatment of the background.

The fraction of centrals that are\nred does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses,\nwhereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite\nquenching efficiency, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched\nupon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent\nof stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity. The red fraction\nof satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity, a measure of\nlocation within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e. dark\nmatter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local\ndensity and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the halo mass gives\nclues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show\nthat the action of mass-quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of\nthe DM mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al (2010) approach to\npredict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into\npassive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed\nmass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this\nphenomenological approach.

We conclude that the star formation surface\ndensity is sufficient for superbubble blowout into the halo, but the cosmic ray\nelectrons may play a critical role in determining whether this outflow develops\ninto a fountain or escapes from the gravitational potential. The high\ndust-to-gas ratio in the dust spur suggests the material was pulled out of NGC\n891 through the collision of a minihalo with the disk of NGC 891. We conclude\nthat NGC 891 offers an example of both feedback and satellite interactions\ntransporting dust into the halo of a typical galaxy.\n"}

However, the existing RL-based TSC system often overlooks\nimperfect observations caused by degraded communication, such as packet loss,\ndelays, and noise, as well as rare real-life events not included in the reward\nfunction, such as unconsidered emergency vehicles. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel integration framework that combines a large\nlanguage model (LLM) with RL. This framework is designed to manage overlooked\nelements in the reward function and gaps in state information, thereby\nenhancing the policies of RL agents. In our approach, RL initially makes\ndecisions based on observed data. Subsequently, LLMs evaluate these decisions\nto verify their reasonableness. If a decision is found to be unreasonable, it\nis adjusted accordingly. Additionally, this integration approach can be\nseamlessly integrated with existing RL-based TSC systems without necessitating\nmodifications. Extensive testing confirms that our approach reduces the average\nwaiting time by $17.5\\%$ in degraded communication conditions as compared to\ntraditional RL methods, underscoring its potential to advance practical RL\napplications in intelligent transportation systems.

While NP-hard in the worst case, there are\nprovably efficient algorithms for certain families of team game. In particular,\nif the game has common external information, also known as A-loss recall --\ninformally, actions played by non-team members (i.e., the opposing team or\nnature) are either unknown to the entire team, or common knowledge within the\nteam -- then polynomial-time algorithms exist (Kaneko & Kline 1995). In this\npaper, we devise a completely new algorithm for solving team games. It uses a\ntree decomposition of the constraint system representing each team's strategy\nto reduce the number and degree of constraints required for correctness\n(tightness of the mathematical program). Our approach has the bags of the tree\ndecomposition correspond to team-public states. Our algorithm reduces the\nproblem of solving team games to a linear program with at most $O(NW^{w+1})$\nnonzero entries in the constraint matrix, where $N$ is the size of the game\ntree, $w$ is a parameter that depends on the amount of uncommon external\ninformation, and $W$ is the treewidth of the tree decomposition. In\npublic-action games, our program size is bounded by the tighter $2^{O(nt)}N$\nfor teams of $n$ players with $t$ types each. Our algorithm is based on a new\nway to write a custom, concise tree decomposition, and its fast run time does\nnot assume that the decomposition has small treewidth. Since our algorithm\ndescribes the polytope of correlated strategies directly, we get equilibrium\nfinding in correlated strategies for free -- instead of, say, having to run a\ndouble oracle algorithm.

Similarly to the emission S-wave of\nthe high-inclination SW Sex stars, this absorption S-wave has its maximum blue\nvelocity at orbital phase ~0.5. We estimate an orbital inclination for HL Aqr\nin the range 19 < i < 27 deg, which is much lower than that of the\nemission-dominated, non-eclipsing SW Sex stars (i ~ 60-70 deg). This gives rise\nto the interesting possibility of many low-inclination nova-likes actually\nbeing SW Sex stars, but with a very different spectroscopic appearance as they\nshow significant absorption. The increasing blueshifted absorption with\ndecreasing inclination points to the existence of a mass outflow with\nsignificant vertical motion. This six new additions to the SW Sex class\nincrease the presence of non-eclipsing systems to about one third of the whole\nSW Sex population, which therefore makes the requirement of eclipses as a\ndefining criterion for SW Sex membership no longer valid.

It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) and a type Ib\/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of\ninduced gravitational collapse (IGC), induced by the matter ejected from an SN\nIb\/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected to reach the\ncritical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB.\nWe found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray\nemission of this subclass of GRBs. Aims. We test if this standard behavior in\nthe luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become a redshift estimator\nof these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this\nsubclass of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources\nhave an isotropic energy $E_{iso} > 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological\nredshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused on the corresponding\nX-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample\nwith measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in\nthe $0.3-10$ keV rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the\nGRB redshift of the sample without a measured redshift and found results\nconsistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions. The standard\nlate-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common\nphysical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly\nrelated to the creation of the NS from the SN process. This scaling law\nmoreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent beaming in this\nlate phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process. This could be a fundamental\ntool for estimating the redshift of GRBs that belong to this subclass of\nevents. We are currently expanding this subclass of GRBs to further verify the\nuniversal validity of this new redshift estimation method.\n"}

However, a significant reduction in the concentration of air\npollutants has been observed during the rainy season. Recently, a number of\nstudies have been performed to understand the mechanism of removal of air\npollutants due to the rain. These studies have found that rain is helpful in\nremoving many air pollutants from the environment. In this paper, we proposed a\nmathematical model to investigate the role of rain in removal of air pollutants\nand its subsequent impacts on human population.\n"}

Specifically we calculate both the spacetime path of the pulsar\nradio signal and the complex orbital and spin dynamics of a spinning pulsar\naround a Kerr black hole, accounting for spacetime curvature and frame\ndragging, relativistic and gravitational time delay, gravitational light\nbending, temporal and spatial dispersion induced by the presence of plasma\nalong the line of sight and relativistic aberration. This then allows for a\nconsistent time-frequency solution to be generated. Such a framework is key for\nassessing the use of PSR as probes of strong field GR, helping to inform the\ndetection of an EMRB system hosting a PSR and, most essentially, for providing\nan accurate theoretical basis to then compare with observations to test\nfundamental physics.\n"}

However, the\nexpansion speed of the LH is slower than the post-eruption wind, so the star's\npowerful wind may accelerate it.

Here we present a first look at 6 galaxies observed for\nthe Nearby Galaxy Showcase as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations\nacquired between August and November, 2023. These targets, 3 dwarf galaxies\n(HolmbergII, IC10, NGC6822) and 3 spirals (IC342, NGC2403, NGC6744), range in\ndistance from about 0.5 Mpc to 8.8 Mpc. Our assessment of the surface\nbrightness depths in the stacked Euclid images confirms previous estimates in\n100 arcsec^2 regions of 1sigma=30.5 mag\/arcsec^2 for VIS, but slightly deeper\nthan previous estimates for NISP with 1sigma=29.2-29.4 mag\/arcsec^2. By\ncombining Euclid HE, YE, and IE into RGB images, we illustrate the large\nfield-of-view covered by a single Reference Observing Sequence, together with\nexquisite detail on parsec scales in these nearby galaxies. Radial surface\nbrightness and color profiles demonstrate galaxy colors in agreement with\nstellar population synthesis models. Standard stellar photometry selection\ntechniques find approximately 1.3 million stars across the 6 galaxy fields.\nEuclid's resolved stellar photometry allows us to constrain the star-formation\nhistories of these galaxies, by disentangling the distributions of young stars,\nas well as asymptotic giant branch and red giant branch stellar populations. We\nfinally examine 2 galaxies individually for surrounding satellite systems. Our\nanalysis of the ensemble of dwarf satellites around NGC6744 reveals a new\ngalaxy, EDwC1, a nucleated dwarf spheroidal at the end of a spiral arm. Our new\ncensus of the globular clusters around NGC2403 yields 9 new star-cluster\ncandidates, 8 of which with colors indicative of evolved stellar populations.\nIn summary, our investigation of the 6 Showcase galaxies demonstrates that\nEuclid is a powerful probe of the anatomy of nearby galaxies [abridged].\n"}

The proposed\nmethod formulates the estimation problem in a large margin classification\nframework, which allows flexible modeling of the covariate-adjusted Youden\nindex through kernel machines.

Here we report observations of the peculiar GRB 101225A (the\n\"Christmas burst\"). Its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followed\nby a bright X-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual optical\ncounterpart. During the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as an\nexpanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistent\nwith a faint supernova, emerged. We determine its distance to 1.6 Gpc by\nfitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the optical\nemission with a GRB-supernova template. Deep optical observations may have\nrevealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. Our proposed progenitor is a helium\nstar-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling its\nhydrogen envelope. The resulting explosion created a GRB-like jet which gets\nthermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thus\ncreating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernova\ndominated. An alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutron\nstar in the Galaxy (Campana et al. 2011).\n"}

Temporal Point Processes (TPPs)\nprovide a mathematical framework for modeling these sequences, enabling\ninferences such as predicting the arrival time of future events and their\nassociated label, called mark. However, due to model misspecification or lack\nof training data, these probabilistic models may provide a poor approximation\nof the true, unknown underlying process, with prediction regions extracted from\nthem being unreliable estimates of the underlying uncertainty. This paper\ndevelops more reliable methods for uncertainty quantification in neural TPP\nmodels via the framework of conformal prediction. A primary objective is to\ngenerate a distribution-free joint prediction region for an event's arrival\ntime and mark, with a finite-sample marginal coverage guarantee. A key\nchallenge is to handle both a strictly positive, continuous response and a\ncategorical response, without distributional assumptions. We first consider a\nsimple but conservative approach that combines individual prediction regions\nfor the event's arrival time and mark. Then, we introduce a more effective\nmethod based on bivariate highest density regions derived from the joint\npredictive density of arrival times and marks. By leveraging the dependencies\nbetween these two variables, this method excludes unlikely combinations of the\ntwo, resulting in sharper prediction regions while still attaining the\npre-specified coverage level. We also explore the generation of individual\nunivariate prediction regions for events' arrival times and marks through\nconformal regression and classification techniques. Moreover, we evaluate the\nstronger notion of conditional coverage. Finally, through extensive\nexperimentation on both simulated and real-world datasets, we assess the\nvalidity and efficiency of these methods.\n"}

Ideally, Xv should\ncapture node v's affinity to each attribute, which considers not only v's own\nattribute associations, but also those of its connected nodes along edges in G.\nIt is challenging to obtain high-utility embeddings that enable accurate\npredictions; scaling effective ANE computation to massive graphs pushes the\ndifficulty of the problem to a whole new level. Existing solutions largely fail\non such graphs, leading to prohibitive costs, low-quality embeddings, or both.\nThis paper proposes PANE, an effective and scalable approach to ANE computation\nfor massive graphs that achieves state-of-the-art result quality on multiple\nbenchmark datasets.

First, we employ an encoding module\nto obtain multiscale features of the textured surface.

Next, a novel global feature rearrangement\nmodule (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual\ndefects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to\nreconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection\nperformance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect\nrestoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to\nachieve noise-robust defect localization.

The\nchoice was to measure at a given pressure P where the system will go, by\nlowering the temperature, successively from paramagnetic (PM) to HO and then to\nantiferromagnetic phase (AF). Furthermore, in order to verify the selection of\nthe pressure, a macroscopic detection of the phase transitions was also\nachieved in situ via its thermal expansion response detected by a strain gauge\nglued on the crystal.

The origin of\nthis $S_8$ tension has not yet been elucidated and may hint at systematics in\nthe data, unaccounted effects from baryonic physics, or new physics beyond the\nstandard model of cosmology. Baryonic physics may in principle provide a\nnonlinear solution to the tension by suppressing the matter power spectrum more\nstrongly on nonlinear scales than is traditionally assumed. Such a solution\nwould not worsen the Hubble tension, contrary to many other proposed solutions\nto the $S_8$ tension.

We first\nimprove Jerrum's bound using the grundy number, which is the worst number of\ncolors in a greedy coloring.\n  Any graph is $(tw+2)$-mixing, where $tw$ is the treewidth of the graph\n(Cereceda 2006). We prove that the shortest sequence between any two\n$(tw+2)$-colorings is at most quadratic (which is optimal up to a constant\nfactor), a problem left open in Bonamy et al. (2012).\n  We also prove that given any two $(\\chi(G)+1)$-colorings of a cograph (resp.\ndistance-hereditary graph) $G$, we can find a linear (resp. quadratic) sequence\nbetween them. In both cases, the bounds cannot be improved by more than a\nconstant factor for a fixed $\\chi(G)$. The graph classes are also optimal in\nsome sense: one of the smallest interesting superclass of distance-hereditary\ngraphs corresponds to comparability graphs, for which no such property holds\n(even when relaxing the constraint on the length of the sequence). As for\ncographs, they are equivalently the graphs with no induced $P_4$, and there\nexist $P_5$-free graphs that admit no sequence between two of their\n$(\\chi(G)+1)$-colorings.\n  All the proofs are constructivist and lead to polynomial-time recoloring\nalgorithm\n"}

In previous studies, panel cameras have been used to detect\nthe subtle differences between speckle patterns. However, the volume,\nbandwidth, sensitivity, and cost (in non-visible bands) associated with panel\ncameras have hindered their utility in broader applications, especially in high\nspeed and low-cost measurements. In this work, we broke the limitations imposed\nby panel cameras by using a quadrant detector (QD) to capture the speckle\nimages. In the scheme of QD detection, speckle images are directly filtered by\nconvolution, where the kernel is equal to one quarter of a speckle pattern.\nFirst, we proposed an up-sampling algorithm to pre-process the QD data. Then a\nnew convolution neural network (CNN) based algorithm, shallow residual network\n(SRN), was proposed to train the up-sampled images. The experimental results\nshow that a resolution of 4 fm (~ 0.5 MHz) was achieved at 1550nm with an\nupdating speed of ~ 1 kHz. More importantly, the SRN shows excellent\nrobustness. The wavelength can be precisely reconstructed from raw QD data\nwithout any averaging, even where there exists apparent noise. The low-cost,\nsimple structure, high speed and robustness of this design promote the\nspeckle-based wavemeter to the industrial grade.

Second, we introduce the concept of valuable\nlocalization region that can aid to selectively distill the classification and\nlocalization knowledge for a certain region. Combining these two new\ncomponents, for the first time, we show that logit mimicking can outperform\nfeature imitation and the absence of localization distillation is a critical\nreason for why logit mimicking underperforms for years. The thorough studies\nexhibit the great potential of logit mimicking that can significantly alleviate\nthe localization ambiguity, learn robust feature representation, and ease the\ntraining difficulty in the early stage. We also provide the theoretical\nconnection between the proposed LD and the classification KD, that they share\nthe equivalent optimization effect. Our distillation scheme is simple as well\nas effective and can be easily applied to both dense horizontal object\ndetectors and rotated object detectors.

Define the minimum period of a\nclass os self-maps of a fixed set as the minimum of the positive integers such\nthat each map in the class has a periodic point whose period is at most this\nnumber.\n  The problem of the determination of the minimum period of the classes of\nhomeomorphisms of closed surfaces was completely solved, in successive steps,\nfrom 1910 to 1996. The aim of our work is, for each compact, connected,\norientable surface, determine the minimum period of its class of\nhomeomorphisms. If the genus of the considered surface is zero or on, then the\nproblem can be solved by simple techniques. For the case of genus at least two,\nwe have found two upper bounds for the minimum periods, which can be expressed\nas a linear function of the genus and the number of boundary components of the\nsurface. We give certain sufficient conditions under which these upper bounds\nare achieved. In particular, we have proved that the minimum period becomes\nconstant for each genus, provided that the number of boundary components is\nlarge enough. We have also studied the minimum periods of the classes of\nfinite-order maps.\n  This thesis has three branches which are interconnected. One has to do with\nthe application of the fixed-point theory. One of the upper bounds of the\nminimum periods is a consequence of this theory.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it\nis the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical\nseed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational\nwave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D\ngeneral-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the\npostbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to\ndetermine the primary hydrodynamic instability.\n"}

In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe\nan unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and\npredicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive\nobjective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach\nworks surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully\nsupervised methods with much less labeled data.

Then, we propose to perform structural distillation\nby distilling pair-wise similarities.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and\/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

To complete this task of steering quantum states,\none can employ quantum control through a sequence of generalized measurements\nwhich direct the system towards the target state. In an active version of this\nprotocol, the obtained measurement readouts are used to adjust the protocol\non-the-go. This enables a sped-up performance relative to the passive version\nof the protocol, where no active adjustments are included. In this work, we\nconsider such active measurement-driven steering as applied to the challenging\ncase of many-body quantum systems. For helpful decision-making strategies, we\noffer Hilbert-space-orientation techniques, comparable to those used in\nnavigation. The first one is to tie the active-decision protocol to the greedy\naccumulation of the cost function, such as the target state fidelity. We show\nthe potential of a significant speedup, employing this greedy approach to a\nbroad family of Matrix Product State targets. For system sizes considered here,\nan average value of the speedup factor $f$ across this family settles about\n$20$, for some targets even reaching a few thousands.

There is a lower bound of n*log(e)=1.44n bits\nneeded to represent an MPHF. This can be reached by a brute-force algorithm\nthat tries e^n hash function seeds in expectation and stores the first seed\nleading to an MPHF. The most space-efficient previous algorithms for\nconstructing MPHFs all use such a brute-force approach as a basic building\nblock.\n  In this paper, we introduce ShockHash - Small, heavily overloaded cuckoo hash\ntables for minimal perfect hashing. ShockHash uses two hash functions h_0 and\nh_1, hoping for the existence of a function f : S->{0, 1} such that x ->\nh_{f(x)}(x) is an MPHF on S. It then uses a 1-bit retrieval data structure to\nstore f using n + o(n) bits.\n  In graph terminology, ShockHash generates n-edge random graphs until\nstumbling on a pseudoforest - where each component contains as many edges as\nnodes. Using cuckoo hashing, ShockHash then derives an MPHF from the\npseudoforest in linear time. We show that ShockHash needs to try only about\n(e\/2)^n=1.359^n seeds in expectation. This reduces the space for storing the\nseed by roughly n bits (maintaining the asymptotically optimal space\nconsumption) and speeds up construction by almost a factor of 2^n compared to\nbrute-force. Bipartite ShockHash reduces the expected construction time again\nto 1.166^n by maintaining a pool of candidate hash functions and checking all\npossible pairs.\n  ShockHash as a building block within the RecSplit framework can be\nconstructed up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches. It\ncan build an MPHF for 10 million keys with 1.489 bits per key in about half an\nhour. When instead using ShockHash after an efficient k-perfect hash function,\nit achieves space usage similar to the best competitors, while being\nsignificantly faster to construct and query.\n"}

First, we solve the linearized hydrodynamic equations\naround the homogeneous (cooling) state and identify the conditions for\nstability as functions of the wave vector, the dissipation, and the parameters\nof the mixture. As happens for monocomponent systems, the analysis shows that\nthe HCS is unstable to long enough wavelength perturbation. As a second\nproblem, we explore the validity of Onsager's reciprocal relations of a\ngranular binary mixture. As expected, since a granular system is not time\nreversal invariant, Onsager's reciprocal relations do not apply for inelastic\ncollisions. The results show that the absence of the Gibbs state\n(non-Maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution functions describing the\nHCS), the collisional cooling, and the occurrence of different kinetic\ntemperatures for both species (breakdown of energy equipartition) are\nresponsible for a violation of Onsager's relations\n"}

Existing methods predominantly rely on\ngraph-based or sequence-based approaches. While graph-based approaches connect\nusers through shared entities to capture structural information, they remain\nvulnerable to fraudsters who can disrupt or manipulate these connections. In\ncontrast, sequence-based approaches analyze users' behavioral patterns,\noffering robustness against tampering but overlooking the interactions between\nsimilar users. Inspired by cohort analysis in retention and healthcare, this\npaper introduces VecAug, a novel cohort-augmented learning framework that\naddresses these challenges by enhancing the representation learning of target\nusers with personalized cohort information. To this end, we first propose a\nvector burn-in technique for automatic cohort identification, which retrieves a\ntask-specific cohort for each target user. Then, to fully exploit the cohort\ninformation, we introduce an attentive cohort aggregation technique for\naugmenting target user representations. To improve the robustness of such\ncohort augmentation, we also propose a novel label-aware cohort neighbor\nseparation mechanism to distance negative cohort neighbors and calibrate the\naggregated cohort information. By integrating this cohort information with\ntarget user representations, VecAug enhances the modeling capacity and\ngeneralization capabilities of the model to be augmented. Our framework is\nflexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing fraud detection models.\nWe deploy our framework on e-commerce platforms and evaluate it on three fraud\ndetection datasets, and results show that VecAug improves the detection\nperformance of base models by up to 2.48\\% in AUC and 22.5\\% in<EMAIL_ADDRESS>outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly.\n"}

Fitting the free parameters\nin our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar\nmass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed\nin Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the\nmain-sequence.\n  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters\nas $\\dot{M}_\\star \\propto R_\\star^2 \\Omega_\\star^{1.33} M_\\star^{-3.36}$. We\nestimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is\nan order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to\nthe wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of\nthis change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the\nspread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at\na given age.

Type I spicules show a rise and fall and have typical lifetimes of\n150-400 s and maximum ascending velocities of 15-40 km\/s, while type II\nspicules have shorter lifetimes of 50-150 s, faster velocities of 30-110 km\/s,\nand are not seen to fall down, but rather fade at around their maximum length.\nType II spicules are the most common, seen in quiet sun and coronal holes. Type\nI spicules are seen mostly in active regions. There are regional differences\nbetween quiet sun and coronal hole spicules, likely attributable to the\ndifferent field configurations. The properties of type II spicules are\nconsistent with published results of Rapid Blueshifted Events (RBEs),\nsupporting the hypothesis that RBEs are their disk counterparts.

We improve upon these methods with\nSMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics), which\nfaithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key\nlimitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training\nformulation, and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For\ntraining, most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted\nface mesh with the input image, along with a plethora of additional loss\nfunctions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide\nsupervision to optimize for 3D face geometry, camera, albedo, and lighting,\nwhich is an ill-posed optimization problem, but the domain gap between\nrendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead, SMIRK\nreplaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that,\ngiven the rendered predicted mesh geometry, and sparsely sampled pixels of the\ninput image, generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color\ninformation from sampled image pixels, supervising with neural rendering-based\nreconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further, it enables us to\ngenerate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training.\nThese are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as\nsupervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training\ndata and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative,\nquantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK\nachieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression\nreconstruction.

All\nmixing angles and gauge couplings are fixed by rotation of the U(1) gauge\nfields to a basis diagonal in hypercharge Y and in an anomaly free linear\ncombination of I_R and B-L. The anomalous $Z'$ gauge boson obtains a string\nscale St\\\"uckelberg mass via a 4D version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. To\nkeep the realization of the Higgs mechanism minimal, we add an extra SU(2)\nsinglet complex scalar, which acquires a VEV and gives a TeV-scale mass to the\nnon-anomalous gauge boson Z\". The model is fully predictive and can be\nconfronted with dijet and dilepton data from LHC8 and, eventually, LHC14. We\nshow that M_{Z\"} \\approx 3 - 4 TeV saturates current limits from the CMS and\nATLAS collaborations. We also show that for M_{Z\"} \\alt 5 TeV, LHC14 will reach\ndiscovery sensitivity \\agt 5\\sigma. After that, we demostrate in all generality\nthat Z\" milli-weak interactions could play an important role in observational\ncosmology. Finally, we examine some phenomenological aspects of the\nsupersymmetric extension of the D-brane construct.\n"}

A set of numerical experiments are provided to\nshow the effectiveness, particularly, much faster convergence of GAITA as\ncompared with the classical iterative thresholding algorithms.\n"}

In this article I trace Ken\nKellermann's early investigations of these sources, which played a major role\nin justifying the development of modern-day VLBI techniques. I describe how our\nunderstanding of these AGN has progressed since Kellermann's early discoveries,\nand discuss several ways in which the current classification scheme can be\nsimplified to reflect intrinsic source characteristics, rather than\nobserver-biased quantities. Finally, I discuss recent results from the VLBA 2\ncm survey concerning the relativistic jet kinematics of the two-sided\npeaked-spectrum sources 4C +12.50 (PKS 1345+125) and OQ 208 (1404+286).\n"}

We use an explicit recovery channel known as the twirled Petz map,\nand study distance measures such as the fidelity, relative entropy, and trace\ndistance between the original state and the recovered state. One setup we study\nin detail involves three contiguous intervals $A$, $B$ and $C$ on a spatial\nslice, where we can view these quantities as measuring correlations between $A$\nand $C$ that are not mediated by the region $B$ that lies between them. We show\nthat each of the distance measures is both UV finite and independent of the\noperator content of the CFT, and hence depends only on the central charge and\nthe cross-ratio of the intervals. We evaluate these universal quantities\nnumerically using lattice simulations in critical spin chain models, and derive\ntheir analytic forms in the limit where $A$ and $C$ are close using the OPE\nexpansion. In the case where $A$ and $C$ are far apart, we find a surprising\nnon-commutativity of the replica trick with the OPE limit. For all values of\nthe cross-ratio, the fidelity is strictly better than a general\ninformation-theoretic lower bound in terms of the conditional mutual\ninformation. We also compare the mutual information between various subsystems\nin the original and recovered states, which leads to a more qualitative\nunderstanding of the differences between them. Further, we introduce\ngeneralizations of the recovery operation to more than three adjacent\nintervals, for which the fidelity is again universal with respect to the\noperator content.\n"}
