with large samples is a central problem in describing friction microscopically.
Calculation of the reduced density matrix appears to be the most suitable metho
to study such systems that are coupled to a large environment. In this paper
the time evolution of the reduced density matrix has been evaluated for an
arbitrary system coupled to a heat reservoir. The formalism is then applied to
study the vibrational relaxation following the stick-slip motion of a small
adsorbate on a surface. The frequency dependence of the relaxation time is also
determined.

Observation of single-particle gap opening and band-folding provides direct
evidence of anisotropic particle-hole instability on the Fermi surface due to
its unique topology. Kinematic overlap of the measured Fermi surface is
observed with the $\sqrt{3}$x$\sqrt{3}$ cobalt charge-order Brillouin zone near
x=1/3 but not at x=1/2 where insulating transition is actually observed. Unlike
conventional density-waves, charge-stripes or band insulators, the on-set of
the gap depends on the quasiparticle's quantum coherence which is found to
occur well below the disorder-order symmetry breaking temperature of the
crystal (the first known example of its kind).

symmetric pure states of multipartite qubit systems, in particular the question
of maximum entanglement. This is done with the help of the Majorana
representation, which maps an n qubit symmetric state to n points on the unit
sphere. It is shown how symmetries of the point distribution can be exploited
to simplify the calculation of entanglement and also help find the maximally
entangled symmetric state. Using a combination of analytical and numerical
results, the most entangled symmetric states for up to 12 qubits are explored
and discussed. The optimization problem on the sphere presented here is then
compared with two classical optimization problems on the S^2 sphere, namely
Toth's problem and Thomson's problem, and it is observed that, in general, they
are different problems.

learning models that use data from a single source, such as that from a wrist
wearable device, to monitor physical activities, assess health risks, and
provide immediate health recommendations or interventions. However, the
limitation of using single-source data often compromises the model's accuracy,
as it fails to capture the full scope of human activities. While a more
comprehensive dataset can be gathered in a lab setting using multiple sensors
attached to various body parts, this approach is not practical for everyday use
due to the impracticality of wearing multiple sensors. To address this
challenge, we introduce a transfer learning framework that optimizes machine
learning models for everyday applications by leveraging multi-source data
collected in a laboratory setting. We introduce a novel metric to leverage the
inherent relationship between these multiple data sources, as they are all
paired to capture aspects of the same physical activity. Through numerical
experiments, our framework outperforms existing methods in classification
accuracy and robustness to noise, offering a promising avenue for the
enhancement of daily activity monitoring.

atmosphere, or a planet with a composition dominated by water. In the case of a
hydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes may
result in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. The aim of
this paper is to measure these variations. We have obtained observations of the
transit of GJ1214b in the r- and I-band with the INT, in the g, r, i and z
bands with the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope, in the Ks-band with the NOT, and in
the Kc-band with the WHT. By comparing the transit depth between the the
different bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, the
atmosphere is investigated. We do not detect clearly significant variations in
the planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. Although the ratio at
the shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the other
bands. The uncertainties in the Ks and Kc bands are large, due to systematic
features in the light curves. The tentative increase in the planet-to-star size
ratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in the
effective planet-size due to Rayleigh scattering, which would require GJ1214b
to have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. If true, then the atmosphere has to have
both clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, as
well as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in the
near- and mid-infrared. However, star spots, which are known to be present on
the hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations in
planet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .
A hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared points
sufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with a
water-dominated atmosphere. [abridged]

proton-proton collider with a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, is to
search for New Physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). A widely favoured BSM
candidate is Supersymmetry (SUSY), which postulates a superpartner for each
Standard Model particle. The first part of this thesis describes a strategy for
an early discovery of SUSY using the trilepton signature, with a focus on
gravity-mediated SUSY breaking, mSUGRA. The discovery potential for SUSY for
the case where strongly interacting supersymmetric particles are very massive
is critically investigated. A possible choice of triggers for L = 10-31cm-2s-1
is suggested by optimising the event yield at intermediate and final selection
stages. A novel method to measure the rate of leptons from heavy flavour decays
passing isolation requirements by isolating tt events in data is outlined.
  The task of the ATLAS silicon tracker is to track particles produced in
proton-proton collisions in its centre, measuring their momenta and production
vertices. The precise knowledge of the silicon tracker module positions and
their orientation in space (alignment) down to some microns and fractions of a
miliradian in the critical coordinates is of vital importance for large parts
of the ambitious ATLAS physics program. In the second part of the thesis, the
alignment of the ATLAS silicon tracker using the Robust Alignment algorithm and
particle tracks is described. The algorithm is applied to align end-cap A of
the pixel detector using cosmic ray particle tracks recorded during its
on-surface commissioning in 2006. Finally, about 2M cosmic ray tracks collected
by ATLAS in situ in autumn 2008 are utilised to provide a coherent alignment of
the entire silicon tracker with the Robust Alignment algorithm.

blackbody with a temperature of \sim 0.08 keV could be present, probably
emitted by the matter at the magnetosphere. We also performed a spectral
analysis during the X-ray eclipse. The spectral evolution during the eclipse
can be well described by a progressive covering of the primary Comptonization
spectrum that is scattered into the line of sight. During the deep eclipse this
spectrum also softens, suggesting that the dust-scattered component becomes
important. An alternative, more complex model, with an emission iron line and
scattered components (as the one that has been used to fit the eclipse of
Centaurus X-3), also gives a good fit of the deep-eclipse data.

results is shown to be responsible for the existence of all quantum
correlations, with the upper bound on their strength stemming from the maximum
of possible torsion within all norm-composing parallelizable manifolds. A
profound interplay is thus uncovered between the existence and strength of
quantum correlations and the parallelizability of the spheres S^0, S^1, S^3,
and S^7 necessitated by the four real division algebras. In particular,
parallelization within a unit 3-sphere is shown to be responsible for the
existence of EPR and Hardy type correlations, whereas that within a unit
7-sphere is shown to be responsible for the existence of all GHZ type
correlations. Moreover, parallelizability in general is shown to be equivalent
to the completeness criterion of EPR, in addition to necessitating the locality
condition of Bell. It is therefore shown to predetermine both the local
outcomes as well as the quantum correlations among the remote outcomes,
dictated by the infinite factorizability of points within the spheres S^3 and
S^7. The twin illusions of quantum entanglement and non-locality are thus shown
to stem from the topologically incomplete accountings of the measurement
results.

find that the filament orientation with respect to the Galactic plane exhibits
a bimodal distribution, a double-Gaussian fitting of which has two centres
located at $-38.1^\circ $ and $42.0^\circ $, with 1$\sigma$ of the two Gaussian

nonlinear systems for convex dissipativity based analysis and controller
synthesis. However, as has been shown recently in literature, naive application
of these tools to nonlinear systems for analysis and controller synthesis can
fail to provide the desired guarantees. Namely, only performance and stability
with respect to the origin is guaranteed. In this paper, inspired by the
results for continuous-time nonlinear systems, the notion of incremental
dissipativity for discrete-time nonlinear systems is proposed, whereby
stability and performance analysis is done between trajectories. Furthermore,
it is shown how, through the use of the LPV framework, convex conditions can be

proposes FS-GAN, a federated self-supervised learning framework to support
automatic traffic analysis and synthesis over a large number of heterogeneous

Networks (GANs), with a set of generators, each being designed to generate
synthesized data samples following the distribution of an individual service
traffic, and each discriminator being trained to differentiate the synthesized
data samples and the real data samples of a local dataset. A federated
learning-based framework is adopted to coordinate local model training
processes of different GANs across different datasets. FS-GAN can classify data
of unknown types of service and create synthetic samples that capture the
traffic distribution of the unknown types. We prove that FS-GAN can minimize
the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the distribution of real data
across all the datasets and that of the synthesized data samples. FS-GAN also
maximizes the JSD among the distributions of data samples created by different
generators, resulting in each generator producing synthetic data samples that
follow the same distribution as one particular service type. Extensive
simulation results show that the classification accuracy of FS-GAN achieves
over 20% improvement in average compared to the state-of-the-art
clustering-based traffic analysis algorithms. FS-GAN also has the capability to
synthesize highly complex mixtures of traffic types without requiring any

we have a graph on $n$ vertices and an initial allocation with at least $f(n)$
chips on each vertex, then the number of chips on each vertex will remain
non-negative. We answer their question in the affirmative, showing further that
$f(n)=n-2$ is the best possible bound. We also consider the existence of a
similar bound $g(d)$ for each $d$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the
graph.

the transformation of pathological images into pseudo-healthy equivalents.
Nonetheless, standard approaches may compromise critical information during
pathology removal, leading to restorations that do not align with unaffected
regions in the original scans. Such discrepancies can inadvertently increase
false positive rates and reduce specificity, complicating radiological
evaluations. This paper introduces Temporal Harmonization for Optimal
Restoration (THOR), which refines the de-noising process by integrating
implicit guidance through temporal anomaly maps. THOR aims to preserve the
integrity of healthy tissue in areas unaffected by pathology. Comparative
evaluations show that THOR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods in
detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain MRIs and wrist X-rays. Code:

spinons in one-dimensional chains, are generally viewed as belonging to the
domain of 3d transition metal systems with spins 1/2. Our neutron scattering
experiments on the 4f-electron metal Yb$_2$Pt$_2$Pb overturn this common
wisdom. We observe broad magnetic continuum dispersing in only one direction,
which indicates that the underlying elementary excitations are spinons carrying
fractional spin-1/2. These spinons are the quantum dynamics of the anisotropic,
orbital-dominated Yb moments, and thus these effective quantum spins are
emergent variables that encode the electronic orbitals. The unique birthmark of
their unusual origin is that only longitudinal spin fluctuations are
measurable, while the transverse excitations such as spin waves are virtually
invisible to magnetic neutron scattering. The proliferation of these
orbital-spinons strips the electrons of their orbital identity, and we thus
report here a new electron fractionalization phenomenon, charge-orbital
separation.

of the discrete time translational invariance imposed by an external periodic
drive. No consensus on the definition has been reached as yet, but important
aspects comprise robustness against small variations of the parameters and the
initial quantum state. Often, disorder and interaction are thought to be
essential ingredients for the occurrence of time crystals. We study a
finite-length polarized XX spin chain engineered to display a spectrum of
equidistant energy levels without drive and show that it keeps a spectrum of
equidistant quasienergies in Floquet theory for a large variety of periodic
driving schemes. This interesting behavior is explained by mapping the XX spin
chain with $N+1$ sites to a single large spin with $S=N/2$ invoking the closure
of the group SU(2). For suitably tuned parameters this system realizes time
crystals of various periodicities for \emph{all} initial states. The robustness
against variations of the parameters is also discussed. Thereby, we establish a
clean system without interaction which can display the phenomenon of time
crystallization.

Reactive programming favors a wide class of contemporary software systems that
respond to user input, network messages, and other events. While reactive
programming is an active field of research, the implementation of reactive
concepts remains challenging. In particular, change detection represents a hard
but inevitable necessity when implementing reactive concepts. Typically, change
detection mechanisms are not intended for reuse but are tightly coupled to the
particular change resolution mechanism. As a result, developers often have to
re-implement similar abstractions. A reusable primitive for change detection is
still missing. To find a suitable primitive, we identify commonalities in
existing reactive concepts. We discover a class of reactive concepts,
state-based reactive concepts. All state-based reactive concepts share a common
change detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an
expression. On the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism,
we propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the
tedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease
the implementation of reactive programming concepts. We evaluate the design of
active expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive
concepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness
of active expressions. Active expressions enable the separation of essential
from non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts. By
using active expressions as a primitive for change detection, developers of
reactive language constructs and runtime support can now focus on the design of
how application programmers should be able to react to change. Ultimately, we
would like active expressions to encourage experiments with novel reactive
programming concepts and with that to yield a wider variety of them to explore.

training samples needed to reach a prescribed accuracy in a learning problem

terms of a generalization error, that is, an expected value of a given loss
function. However, for several applications -- for example in a
security-critical context or for problems in the computational sciences --
accuracy in this sense is not sufficient. In such cases, one would like to have
guarantees for high accuracy on every input value, that is, with respect to the
uniform norm. In this paper we precisely quantify the number of training
samples needed for any conceivable training algorithm to guarantee a given
uniform accuracy on any learning problem formulated over target classes

in rapidly oscillating Ap stars, systematic errors are likely to be present
when determining their effective temperatures, which potentially compromises
asteroseismic studies of these pulsators. Using long-baseline interferometry,
our goal is to determine accurate angular diameters of a number of roAp targets
to provide a temperature calibration for these stars. We obtained
interferometric observations of 10 Aql with the visible spectrograph VEGA at
the CHARA array. We determined a limb-darkened angular diameter of
0.275+/-0.009 mas and deduced a linear radius of 2.32+/-0.09 R_sun. We
estimated the star's bolometric flux and used it, in combination with its
parallax and angular diameter, to determine the star's luminosity and effective
temperature. For two data sets of bolometric flux we derived an effective
temperature of 7800+/-170 K and a luminosity of 18+/-1 L_sun or of 8000+/-210 K
and 19+/-2 L_sun. We used these fundamental parameters together with the large
frequency separation to constrain the mass and the age of 10 Aql, using the
CESAM stellar evolution code. Assuming a solar chemical composition and
ignoring all kinds of diffusion and settling of elements, we obtained a mass of
1.92 M_sun and an age of 780 Gy or a mass of 1.95 M_sun and an age of 740 Gy,
depending on the considered bolometric flux. For the first time, we managed to
determine an accurate angular diameter for a star smaller than 0.3 mas and to
derive its fundamental parameters. In particular, by only combining our
interferometric data and the bolometric flux, we derived an effective
temperature that can be compared to those derived from atmosphere models. Such
fundamental parameters can help for testing the mechanism responsible for the
excitation of the oscillations observed in the magnetic pulsating stars.

simulations a low-resolution model of the multilayer and absorber stack with

obtained results that optical selection rules result from the wave function
parity factor $(-1)^J$, where $J$ is the band number. These selection rules are
that $\Delta J$ is odd for transitions between valence and conduction subbands

the two structures that should allow one to use them interchangeably in some

singularities in the tubes are centered between those in the ribbons if the
ribbon width is about a half of the tube circumference. The analysis of the
matrix elements dependence on the electron wave vector for narrow ribbons shows
a smooth non-singular behavior at the Dirac points and the points where the

of an AGN that may be exhibiting not only inconstancy in AGN output but also
inconstancy in direction of ejection axis. Its radio morphology shows evidence
for a restarting of the jets accompanied by an axis change. The observed
side-to-side asymmetries of this giant radio galaxy suggest that the new jets

central engine at a rate of a few degrees Myr^-1. The closer location of the

is supportive of the restarting and axis-change model for the formation of the

demonstrate rate gains for this problem over traditional coding schemes using

new rate region is strictly bigger than the Berger-Tung rate region, which has
been the best known achievable rate region for this problem till now. Further,
there is no known unstructured random coding scheme that achieves these rate

we analyze the effect of augmenting domain experts with explainable AI in the
form of visual heatmaps. We then compare participants that were either
supported by (a) black-box AI or (b) explainable AI, where the latter supports
them to follow AI predictions when the AI is accurate or overrule the AI when

However, the existing sign language translation methods need to read all the
videos before starting the translation, which leads to a high inference latency

problem, we propose SimulSLT, the first end-to-end simultaneous sign language
translation model, which can translate sign language videos into target text

a masked encoder. We 1) use the wait-k strategy for simultaneous translation.
2) design a novel boundary predictor based on the integrate-and-fire module to
output the gloss boundary, which is used to model the correspondence between
the sign language video and the gloss. 3) propose an innovative re-encode
method to help the model obtain more abundant contextual information, which
allows the existing video features to interact fully. The experimental results

BLEU scores that exceed the latest end-to-end non-simultaneous sign language

video-specific visual content and corresponding representative words. Moreover,
a framework with hierarchical visual representations and an optimized
hierarchical attention mechanism is established to capture the most salient

the mRNA molecule, called the ribosome flow model with extended objects
(RFMEO). This model encapsulates many realistic features of translation
including non-homogeneous transition rates along the mRNA, the fact that every
ribosome covers several codons, and the fact that ribosomes cannot overtake one
another.
  The RFMEO is a mean-field approximation of an important model from
statistical mechanics called the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process
with extended objects (TASEPEO). We demonstrate that the RFMEO describes
biophysical aspects of translation better than previous mean-field
approximations, and that its predictions correlate well with those of TASEPEO.
However, unlike TASEPEO, the RFMEO is amenable to rigorous analysis using tools
from systems and control theory. We show that the ribosome density profile
along the mRNA in the RFMEO converges to a unique steady-state density that
depends on the length of the mRNA, the transition rates along it, and the
number of codons covered by every ribosome, but not on the initial density of
ribosomes along the mRNA. In particular, the protein production rate also
converges to a unique steady-state. Furthermore, if the transition rates along
the mRNA are periodic with a common period T then the ribosome density along
the mRNA and the protein production rate converge to a unique periodic pattern
with period T, that is, the model entrains to periodic excitations in the
transition rates.
  We believe that the RFMEO could be useful for modeling, understanding, and
re-engineering translation as well as other important biological processes.

gravity-darkening exponents for white dwarfs in the literature. On the other
hand, the number of known eclipsing binaries whose components are tidally
and/or rotationally distorted white dwarfs is increasing year on year.
  Our main objective is to present the first theoretical approaches to the
problem of the distribution of temperatures on the surfaces of compact stars
distorted by rotation and/or tides in order to compare with relevant
observational data.
  We find discrepancies between the gravity-darkening exponents calculated with
our methods and the predictions of the von Zeipel theorem, particularly in the
cases of cold white dwarfs; although the discrepancy also applies to higher
effective temperatures under determined physical conditions. We find physical
connections between the gravity-darkening exponents calculated using our
modified method of triangles strategy with the convective efficiency (defined
here as the ratio of the convective to the total flux). A connection between
the entropy and the gravity-darkening coefficients is also found: variations of
the former cause changes in the way the temperature is distributed on distorted
stellar surfaces.

robotic capture and stabilization of orbital objects in a time-critical manner.
The method takes into account various operational and physical constraints,
including ensuring a smooth capture, handling line-of-sight (LOS) obstructions
of the target, and staying within the acceleration, force, and torque limits of
the robot. Our approach involves the development of an optimal control
framework for an eye-to-hand visual servoing method, which integrates two
sequential sub-maneuvers: a pre-capturing maneuver and a post-capturing
maneuver, aimed at achieving the shortest possible capture time. Integrating
both control strategies enables a seamless transition between them, allowing
for real-time switching to the appropriate control system. Moreover, both
controllers are adaptively tuned through vision feedback to account for the
unknown dynamics of the target. The integrated estimation and control
architecture also facilitates fault detection and recovery of the visual
feedback in situations where the feedback is temporarily obstructed. The
experimental results demonstrate the successful execution of pre- and
post-capturing operations on a tumbling and drifting target, despite multiple
operational constraints.

Pseudo-label (PL) methods, e.g., FixMatch and FreeMatch, obtain the State Of
The Art (SOTA) performances in SSL. These approaches employ a
threshold-to-pseudo-label (T2L) process to generate PLs by truncating the
confidence scores of unlabeled data predicted by the self-training method.
However, self-trained models typically yield biased and high-variance
predictions, especially in the scenarios when a little labeled data are

J1731-347 / G353.6-0.7 shows no pulsations and exhibits a blackbody-like X-ray
spectrum. If the absence of pulsations is interpreted as evidence for the
emitting surface area being the entire neutron star surface, the assumption of
the measured flux being due to a blackbody emission translates into a source
distance that is inconsistent with current estimates of the remnant's distance.
Aims: With the best available observational data, we extended the pulse period
search down to a sub-millisecond time scale and used a carbon atmosphere model
to describe the X-ray spectrum of the CCO and to estimate geometrical
parameters of the neutron star. Methods: To search for pulsations we used data
of an observation of the source with XMM-Newton performed in timing mode. For
the spectral analysis, we used earlier XMM-Newton observations performed in
imaging mode, which permits a more accurate treatment of the background. The
carbon atmosphere models used to fit the CCO spectrum are computed assuming
hydrostatic and radiative equilibria and take into account pressure ionization
and the presence of spectral lines. Results: Our timing analysis did not reveal
any pulsations with a pulsed fraction above ~8% down to 0.2 ms. This finding
further supports the hypothesis that the emitting surface area is the entire
neutron star surface. The carbon atmosphere model provides a good fit to the
CCO spectrum and leads to a normalization consistent with the available
distance estimates of the remnant. The derived constraints on the mass and
radius of the source are consistent with reasonable values of the neutron star
mass and radius. After the CCO in Cas A, the CCO in HESS J1731-347 / G353.6-0.7
is the second object of this class for which a carbon atmosphere model provides
a consistent description of X-ray emission.

accuracy and efficiency. The points in this tradeoff space are determined,
among other factors, by different data types but also evaluation orders. To put
it simply, the shorter a precision's bit-length, the larger the roundoff error
will be, but the faster the program will run. Similarly, the fewer arithmetic
operations the program performs, the faster it will run; however, the effect on
the roundoff error is less clear-cut. Manually optimizing the efficiency of
finite-precision programs while ensuring that results remain accurate enough is
challenging. The unintuitive and discrete nature of finite-precision makes
estimation of roundoff errors difficult; furthermore the space of possible data
types and evaluation orders is prohibitively large. We present the first fully
automated and sound technique and tool for optimizing the performance of
floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic kernels. Our technique combines
rewriting and mixed-precision tuning. Rewriting searches through different
evaluation orders to find one which minimizes the roundoff error at no
additional runtime cost. Mixed-precision tuning assigns different finite
precisions to different variables and operations and thus provides
finer-grained control than uniform precision. We show that when these two
techniques are designed and applied together, they can provide higher
performance improvements than each alone.

precise conditions for the validity of this L\'evy flight foraging hypothesis
(LFH) have been widely described in the literature [Phys. Life Rev. 14, 94

recently for $d \geq 2$: (i) the capture rate $\eta$ has linear dependence on
the target density $\rho$ for all values of the L\'evy index $\alpha$; (ii)
""the gain $\eta_{max}/\eta$ achieved by varying $\alpha $ is bounded even in
the limit $\rho \to 0 $"" so that ""tuning $\alpha$ can only yield a marginal
gain""; (iii) depending on the values of the radius of detection $a$, the
restarting distance $l_c$ and the scale parameter $s$, the optimum is realized
for a range of $\alpha$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 080601 (2020)]. Here we answer

a stationary rainfall distribution and neglect many uncertainties. These
assumptions are inconsistent with observations that suggest intensifying
extreme precipitation events and the uncertainties surrounding projections of
the coupled natural-human systems. Here we demonstrate a safety factor approach
to designing urban infrastructure in a changing climate. Our results show that
assuming climate stationarity and neglecting deep uncertainties can drastically
underestimate flood risks and lead to poor infrastructure design choices. We
find that climate uncertainty dominates the socioeconomic and engineering
uncertainties that impact the hydraulic reliability in stormwater drainage
systems. We quantify the upfront costs needed to achieve higher hydraulic
reliability and robustness against the deep uncertainties surrounding
projections of rainfall, surface runoff characteristics, and infrastructure
lifetime. Depending on the location, we find that adding safety factors of 1.4
to 1.7 to the standard stormwater pipe design guidance produces robust
performance to the considered deep uncertainties. The insights gained from this
study highlight the need for updating traditional engineering design strategies
to improve infrastructure reliability under socioeconomic and environmental
changes.

as BERT and RoBERTa, provide strong performance across a wide range of tasks
and are ubiquitous in modern NLP. It has been observed that fine-tuning these
models on tasks involving data from domains different from that on which they
were pretrained can lead to suboptimal performance. Recent work has explored
approaches to adapt pretrained language models to new domains by incorporating
additional pretraining using domain-specific corpora and task data. We propose
an alternative approach for transferring pretrained language models to new
domains by adapting their tokenizers. We show that domain-specific subword
sequences can be efficiently determined directly from divergences in the
conditional token distributions of the base and domain-specific corpora. In
datasets from four disparate domains, we find adaptive tokenization on a
pretrained RoBERTa model provides >97% of the performance benefits of domain
specific pretraining. Our approach produces smaller models and less training
and inference time than other approaches using tokenizer augmentation. While
adaptive tokenization incurs a 6% increase in model parameters in our
experimentation, due to the introduction of 10k new domain-specific tokens, our
approach, using 64 vCPUs, is 72x faster than further pretraining the language
model on domain-specific corpora on 8 TPUs.

contrary to previous assumptions that they could only exist in magnetic
systems. Wang et al. observed that the SP-WPs with opposite and even chiral

such SP-WPs by searching the encyclopedia of emergent particles in
three-dimensional crystals. Our finds were confirmed through the phonon spectra

discovery broadens the range of materials that can host SP-WPs and applies to

being corrected by the user, is used as a new seed in the next iteration, so
more patterns are created each time. We also take advantage of the corrections
made by the user to score the patterns and therefore rank the generated

use of general (non-Hilbert) Banach spaces has recently found much interest due
to its usefulness in many applications. This motivates us to extend the second
order method previously considered by the author in a Hilbert space setting,
(see also Hettlich and Rundell 2000) to a Banach space setting and analyze its
convergence. We here show rates results for a particular source condition and
different exponents in the formulation of Tikhonov regularization in each step.

language inference. Our encoder is based on stacked bidirectional LSTM-RNNs
with shortcut connections and fine-tuning of word embeddings. The overall
supervised model uses the above encoder to encode two input sentences into two
vectors, and then uses a classifier over the vector combination to label the
relationship between these two sentences as that of entailment, contradiction,
or neural. Our Shortcut-Stacked sentence encoders achieve strong improvements
over existing encoders on matched and mismatched multi-domain natural language
inference (top non-ensemble single-model result in the EMNLP RepEval 2017

case of Smodels programs under the stable model semantics. The composition of
Smodels program modules is suitably limited by module conditions which ensure
the compatibility of the module system with stable models. Hence the semantics
of an entire Smodels program depends directly on stable models assigned to its
modules. This result is formalized as a module theorem which truly strengthens
Lifschitz and Turner's splitting-set theorem for the class of Smodels programs.
To streamline generalizations in the future, the module theorem is first proved
for normal programs and then extended to cover Smodels programs using a
translation from the latter class of programs to the former class. Moreover,
the respective notion of module-level equivalence, namely modular equivalence,
is shown to be a proper congruence relation: it is preserved under
substitutions of modules that are modularly equivalent. Principles for program
decomposition are also addressed. The strongly connected components of the
respective dependency graph can be exploited in order to extract a module
structure when there is no explicit a priori knowledge about the modules of a
program. The paper includes a practical demonstration of tools that have been
developed for automated (de)composition of Smodels programs.

possible restrictions on Brouwer degrees of equivariant maps between
representation spheres $S(V)$ and $S(W)$ are usually expressed in a form of
congruences modulo the greatest common divisor of lengths of orbits in $S(V)$
(denoted $\alpha(V)$). Effective applications of these congruences is limited
by answers to the following questions: (i) under which conditions, is
${\alpha}(V)>1$? and (ii) does there exist an equivariant map with the degree
easy to calculate? In the present paper, we address both questions. We show
that ${\alpha}(V)>1$ for each irreducible non-trivial $C[G]$-module if and only
if $G$ is solvable. For non-solvable groups, we use 2-transitive actions to
construct complex representations with non-trivial ${\alpha}$-characteristic.
Regarding the second question, we suggest a class of Norton algebras without
2-nilpotents giving rise to equivariant quadratic maps, which admit an explicit
formula for the Brouwer degree.

may lead to the occurrence of quantum dynamics behaviors without classical
dynamic counterparts, such as quantum collapse and revival effects. In this
paper, we focus on studying whether the entanglement entropy and Husimi Q
function, as diagnostic tools for quantum chaos in quantum systems, are
invalidated by quantum collapse and revival. It is shown that the saturation
values of entanglement entropy for initial states located in the chaotic sea of
QRM are higher than that in the regular regions. When the system reaches
dynamic equilibrium, the Husimi Q function which initial states located in the
chaotic sea are more dispersed than that in the regular regions. Moreover, we
observe a good correspondence between the the time-average entanglement entropy

entropy and Husimi Q function maintain the function for diagnosing chaos in the
QRM and the corresponding principle does not be invalidated by quantum collapse
and revival effects in this system.

Peng et al (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. SDSS
groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the
environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are
red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses,
whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite
quenching efficiency, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched
upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent
of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity. The red fraction
of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity, a measure of
location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e. dark
matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local
density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the halo mass gives
clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show
that the action of mass-quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of
the DM mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al (2010) approach to
predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into
passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed
mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this
phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is the
same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the
star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 10^12M\odot, which
emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in
Peng et al (2010). Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the
central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about
25%.

machine learning, with results characterising expressivity, learnability and
generalisation. As yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these
concepts for continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this
paper we represent CV quantum kernels as closed form functions and use this
representation to provide several important theoretical insights. We derive a
general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and show every such
kernel can be expressed as the product of a Gaussian and an algebraic function
of the parameters of the feature map. Furthermore, in the multi-mode case, we
present quantification of a quantum-classical separation for all quantum
kernels via a hierarchical notion of the ""stellar rank"" of the quantum kernel
feature map. We then prove kernels defined by feature maps of infinite stellar
rank, such as GKP-state encodings, can be approximated arbitrarily well by
kernels defined by feature maps of finite stellar rank. Finally, we simulate
learning with a single-mode displaced Fock state encoding and show that (i)
accuracy on our specific task (an annular data set) increases with stellar
rank, (ii) for underfit models, accuracy can be improved by increasing a
bandwidth hyperparameter, and (iii) for noisy data that is overfit, decreasing
the bandwidth will improve generalisation but does so at the cost of effective
stellar rank.

the interaction of power imbalances - represented through the power grid

We use explainable machine learning to identify key dependencies and
disentangle the interaction of critical features. Our results show that
market-based HVDC flows introduce deterministic frequency deviations, which
however can be mitigated through strict ramping limits. Moreover, varying HVDC
operation modes strongly affect the interaction with the grid. In particular,
we show that load-frequency control via HVDC links can both have control-like

from the weak-coupling regime in the Kondo lattice model on a polar square
lattice. We show that a hybrid square skyrmion crystal consisting of Bloch and
N\'eel spin textures emerges even under polar $C_{\rm 4v}$ symmetries when the
ordering wave vectors correspond to low-symmetric wave vectors in momentum
space, which is in contrast to the expectation from the Lifshitz invariants. We
also show the instability toward the anti-skyrmion crystal and rhombic skyrmion
crystal depending on the direction of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector in

positions of emitters and receivers. Nonlinear light-matter interaction in
metasurfaces offers a promising pathway towards miniaturisation of the
asymmetric control of light. Here we demonstrate asymmetric parametric
generation of light in nonlinear metasurfaces. We assemble dissimilar nonlinear
dielectric resonators into translucent metasurfaces that produce images in the
visible spectral range being illuminated by infrared radiation. By design, the
metasurfaces produce different and completely independent images for the
reversed direction of illumination, that is when the positions of the infrared

sequence-to-label problem of line script identification. This makes it harder
to train and inefficient to run. Second, the counting heuristic may be
suboptimal compared to a learned model. Therefore we reframe line script
identification as a sequence-to-label problem and solve it using two
components, trained end-toend: Encoder and Summarizer. The encoder converts a
line image into a feature sequence. The summarizer aggregates the sequence to

model, close to the half-filling. The Harper model, which is a quasi-periodic
system, is different than other one dimensional systems with uncorrelated
disorder in the fact that it can be in the metallic regime. Nevertheless, the
PC for a wide range of parameters of the Harper model does not show typical
metallic behavior, although the system is in the metallic regime. This is a
result of the nature of the central band states, which are a hybridization of
Gaussian states localized in superlattice points. When the superlattice is not
commensurate with the system length, the PC behaves as in an insulator. Thus
even in the metallic regime a typical finite Harper model may exhibit a PC
expected from an insulator.

where emergent sustained behaviours spontaneously arise if stochasticity is
properly taken in account. For example it has been recently found that a
directed linear chain of connected patch of neurons amplifies an input signal,
also tuning its characteristic frequency. Here we study a generalization of
such a simple model, introducing heterogeneity and variability in the parameter
space and long-range interactions, breaking, in turn, the preferential
direction of information transmission of a directed chain. On one hand,
enlarging the region of parameters leads to a more complex state space that we
analytically characterise; moreover, we explicitly link the strength
distribution of the non-local interactions with the frequency distribution of
the network oscillations. On the other hand, we found that adding long-range
interactions can cause the onset of novel phenomena, as coherent and
synchronous oscillations among all the interacting units, which can also
coexist with the amplification of the signal.

the spectrum of Schr\""odinger operator $-4\Delta + R$ on manifolds with

multiplicities, provided that scalar curvatures of cross sections of cones have
a certain lower bound. This enables us to define the $\lambda$-functional on

magnetohydrodynamical simulations and a nested grid technique. First, the
interstellar magnetized cloud experiences a ``runaway collapse'' phase, in
which the central density increases drastically within a finite time scale.
Finally, it enters an accretion phase, in which inflowing matter accretes onto
a central high-density disk or a new-born star. We found that the accretion
rate reaches (4 -- 40) $\times c_s^3/G$, where $c_s$ and $G$ represent the
isothermal sound speed and the gravitational constant, respectively. This is
much larger than the standard accretion rate of $0.975c_s^3/G$ for a
hydrostatic isothermal spherical cloud (Shu 1977, AAA19.065.044). Due to the
effect of an extra infall velocity achieved in the runaway phase ($\sim 2
c_s$), the accretion rate is boosted. This rate declines with time in contrast
to Shu's solution, but keeps $\gtsim 2.5 c_s^3/G$. The observed gas infall rate
around proto-stars such as L1551 IRS 5 and HL Tau is also discussed.

metallicities across the discs of nearby galaxies at scales $\lesssim 100~$ pc.
At such small scales, many of these regions contain too few stars to fully
sample all possible stellar masses and evolutionary states, leading to
stochastic fluctuations in the ionising continuum. The impact of these
fluctuations on the line diagnostics used to infer galaxy metallicities is
poorly understood. In this paper, we quantify this impact for six most
commonly-used diagnostics. We generate stochastic stellar populations for
galaxy patches with star formation rates varying over a factor of $1000$,
compute the nebular emission that results when these stars ionise gas at a wide
range of densities, metallicities, and determine how much inferred
metallicities vary with fluctuations in the driving stellar spectrum. We find
that metallicities derived from diagnostics that measure multiple ionisation
states of their target elements (e.g.~electron temperature methods) are weakly
affected (variation $< 0.1$ dex), but that larger fluctuations ($\sim 0.4$ dex)
occur for diagnostics that depend on a single ionisation state. Scatter in the
inferred metallicity is generally largest at low star formation rate and
metallicity, and is larger for more sensitive observations than for shallower
ones. The main cause of the fluctuations is stochastic variation in the
ionisation state in the nebula in response to the absence of Wolf-Rayet stars,
which dominate the production of $\gtrsim 2-3$ Ryd photons. Our results
quantify the trade-off between line brightness and diagnostic accuracy, and can
be used to optimise observing strategies for future IFU campaigns.

give rise to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Due to the large
dynamical quark mass, the scalar mesons become the q bar{q} bound states. Since
the parameters have been all fixed to reproduce the light pseudoscalar meson
masses and the decay constant, there is no free parameter in the calculation of
the scalar mesons. We obtain $M_{sigma} = 667$ MeV, $M_{a_0} = 942$ MeV and
$M_{f_0} = 1336$ MeV. They are in good agreement with the observed masses of

that these states are the members of the light scalar meson nonet. The mass of

compare time-to-event data in clinical trials, as they are most powerful under
proportional hazards. But there is a loss of power if this assumption is
violated, which is the case for some new oncology drugs like immunotherapies.
We consider a two-stage test procedure, in which the weighting of the log-rank
test statistic depends on a pre-test of the proportional hazards assumption.
I.e., depending on the pre-test either the log-rank or an alternative test is
used to compare the survival probabilities. We show that if naively implemented
this can lead to a substantial inflation of the type-I error rate. To address
this, we embed the two-stage test in a permutation test framework to keep the
nominal level alpha. We compare the operating characteristics of the two-stage
test with the log-rank test and other tests by clinical trial simulations.

(ii) forward and backward propagating modes, or (iii) four evanescent modes
(two in each direction). We also show that the loaded quality factor of uniform
CTLs exhibiting a fourth order EPD at k=0 is robust to series losses due to the
fact that the degenerate modes do not advance in phase. We also provide a
microstrip possible implementation of a uniform CTL exhibiting a DBE using
periodic series capacitors with very sub-wavelength unit-cell length. Finally,
we show an experimental verification of the existence DBE for a microstrip

models in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most existing models aim at
identifying input features such as words or phrases important for model
predictions. Neural models developed in NLP however often compose word
semantics in a hierarchical manner and text classification requires
hierarchical modelling to aggregate local information in order to deal with
topic and label shifts more effectively. As such, interpretation by words or
phrases only cannot faithfully explain model decisions in text classification.
This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical INTerpretable neural text classifier,
called Hint, which can automatically generate explanations of model predictions
in the form of label-associated topics in a hierarchical manner. Model
interpretation is no longer at the word level, but built on topics as the basic
semantic unit. Experimental results on both review datasets and news datasets
show that our proposed approach achieves text classification results on par
with existing state-of-the-art text classifiers, and generates interpretations
more faithful to model predictions and better understood by humans than other
interpretable neural text classifiers.

Our main contribution relates the denotational cost semantics of
$\textbf{PCF}_\mathsf{cost}$ to its computational cost semantics, a new kind of
dynamic semantics for program execution that serves as a mathematically natural
alternative to operational semantics in SDT. In particular we prove an
internal, cost-sensitive version of Plotkin's computational adequacy theorem,
giving a precise correspondence between the denotational and computational
semantics for complete programs at base type. The constructions and proofs of
this paper take place in the internal dependent type theory of an SDT topos
extended by a phase distinction in the sense of Sterling and Harper. By
controlling the interpretation of cost structure via the phase distinction in
the denotational semantics, we show that $\textbf{PCF}_\mathsf{cost}$ programs
also evince a noninterference property of cost and behavior. We verify the
axioms of the type theory by means of a model construction based on relative
sheaf models of SDT.

presents an unsupervised method of ship movement trajectory prediction which
represents the data in a three-dimensional space which consists of time
difference between points, the scaled error distance between the tested and its
predicted forward and backward locations, and the space-time angle. The
representation feature space reduces the search scope for the next point to a
collection of candidates which fit the local path prediction well, and
therefore improve the accuracy. Unlike most statistical learning or deep
learning methods, the proposed clustering-based trajectory reconstruction
method does not require computationally expensive model training. This makes
real-time reliable and accurate prediction feasible without using a training
set. Our results show that the most prediction trajectories accurately consist

CO(1-0) observations of local ULIRGs and QSO hosts: clear signature of massive
and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the
CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of
several 100 Msun/yr. We combine these new observations with data from the
literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows
within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that
starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their SFR, or
even higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be
effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest
that the presence of an AGN can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which
is found to increase with the L_AGN/L_bol ratio. The gas depletion time-scales
due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity
of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in
starburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting
powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow are
much shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. We estimate
the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it
corresponds to about 5% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN
feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 L_AGN/c are common
among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For ""pure"" starburst galaxies
our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly
momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

essentially that mathematics is difficult. Third-graders are not
developmentally ready for the subtlety of fractions, for instance, and even
high-performing students cannot be expected to develop the skills of
experienced users. However we will see that this is far from the whole story

counterproductive for skill development, and the reasons for this are an

their features to obtain favorable predictions. Most current works focus on
simple classifiers that trigger independent user responses. Here we examine the
implications of learning with more elaborate models that break the independence
assumption. Motivated by the idea that applications of strategic classification
are often social in nature, we focus on \emph{graph neural networks}, which
make use of social relations between users to improve predictions. Using a
graph for learning introduces inter-user dependencies in prediction; our key
point is that strategic users can exploit these to promote their goals. As we
show through analysis and simulation, this can work either against the system
-- or for it. Based on this, we propose a differentiable framework for
strategically-robust learning of graph-based classifiers. Experiments on
several real networked datasets demonstrate the utility of our approach.

complexity and variations of clothed people. Given a segmented 2D silhouette of
a person and its inferred 3D joints from the input picture, we first synthesize
consistent silhouettes from novel view points around the subject. The

frontal image and segmentation mask as input to a conditional generative
adversarial network. Our experiments demonstrate that our silhouette-based

method for dimension reduction, clustering, and matrix completion. In this
article we review several important variants of MF, including: Basic MF,
Non-negative MF, Orthogonal non-negative MF. As can be told from their names,

between crime and urban metrics. However, because of non-Gaussian distributions
and multicollinearity in urban indicators, it is common to find controversial
conclusions about the influence of some urban indicators on crime. Machine
learning ensemble-based algorithms can handle well such problems. Here, we use
a random forest regressor to predict crime and quantify the influence of urban
indicators on homicides. Our approach can have up to 97% of accuracy on crime
prediction, and the importance of urban indicators is ranked and clustered in
groups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data
sample analyzed. Our results determine the rank of importance of urban
indicators to predict crime, unveiling that unemployment and illiteracy are the
most important variables for describing homicides in Brazilian cities. We
further believe that our approach helps in producing more robust conclusions
regarding the effects of urban indicators on crime, having potential
applications for guiding public policies for crime control.

utilize an acoustic reference encoder to implicitly model singing

representation of highly-entangled many-body quantum states. In practical
applications, neural-network states inherit numerical schemes used in
Variational Monte Carlo, most notably the use of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo
(MCMC) sampling to estimate quantum expectations. The local stochastic sampling
in MCMC caps the potential advantages of neural networks in two ways: (i) Its
intrinsic computational cost sets stringent practical limits on the width and
depth of the networks, and therefore limits their expressive capacity; (ii) Its
difficulty in generating precise and uncorrelated samples can result in
estimations of observables that are very far from their true value. Inspired by
the state-of-the-art generative models used in machine learning, we propose a
specialized Neural Network architecture that supports efficient and exact
sampling, completely circumventing the need for Markov Chain sampling. We
demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional interacting spin models,
showcasing the ability to obtain accurate results on larger system sizes than

outcomes during testing, a recently designed genuine triaxial apparatus has
enabled the replication of conditions where the three principal stresses
exhibit varying magnitudes. This setup facilitates the examination of fracture
behaviors in materials similar to the 4-series under genuine triaxial stress
states. The experimental findings revealed that the maximum strength
experiences significant influence from the minimum principal stress and the
intermediate principal stress in genuine triaxial stress conditions.
Specifically, for a fixed minimum principal stress ({\sigma}3), there is a
progressive reduction in peak strain as the intermediate principal stress
({\sigma}2) increases. Moreover, as the minimum principal stress ({\sigma}3)
rises, the magnitude of peak strain diminishes. The Young's modulus of the
specimens exhibits an exponential increase with the augmentation of confining
pressure, and it demonstrates a linear growth pattern as the intermediate
principal stress increases. Additionally, the cohesion force is observed to
rise while the internal friction angle decreases with the elevation of the
intermediate principal stress. The failure modes of the specimens in genuine
triaxial stress conditions can be categorized into three types, all of which
exhibit a specific angle between the fracture surface and {\sigma}3, ranging
from 50 to 62 degrees. Furthermore, a comparison between the computed range and
the actual measurement range of the fracture angle highlights several
limitations in the relationship between the fracture angle ({\theta}) and the

broad-band photometry in the rest-frame ultra-violet, optical, and
near-infrared of each of these populations and test a variety of stellar
population synthesis codes, star-formation histories (SFHs), and initial mass

the observed properties of the known populations of white dwarfs in both
interacting and detached binaries. Major limitations are that the existing
population models have generally been developed to explain the properties of
sub-samples of these systems, occupying small volumes of the vast parameter

distribution, given the ability to sample from a given distribution. The method
has been first formalized by von Neumann (1951) and has many applications in
classical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given
a black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum
states with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition
of the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of
this paper is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum
state generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum
rejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our
proof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle which
allows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem.
Our main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to
continuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the
oracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data.
Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a
primitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different
applications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum
algorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd.
Secondly, we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum

spectrum, galaxy bias and galaxy luminosity function given the observations and

explored using the Wiener filter within a Gibbs sampler. We validate the
analysis using simulated catalogues and apply it to VIPERS data taking into

topologies. Recent research shows that temporal correlations in the
chronological ordering of interactions crucially influence network properties
and dynamical processes. How these correlations affect our ability to control
systems with time-varying interactions remains unclear. In this work, we use
higher-order network models to extend the framework of structural
controllability to temporal networks, where the chronological ordering of
interactions gives rise to time-respecting paths with non-Markovian
characteristics. We study six empirical data sets and show that non-Markovian
characteristics of real systems can both increase or decrease the minimum time
needed to control the whole system. With both empirical data and synthetic
models, we further show that spectral properties of generalisations of graph
Laplacians to higher-order networks can be used to analytically capture the
effect of temporal correlations on controllability. Our work highlights that
(i) correlations in the chronological ordering of interactions are an important
source of complexity that significantly influences the controllability of
temporal networks, and (ii) higher-order network models are a powerful tool to
understand the temporal-topological characteristics of empirical systems.

model to effectively capture the dynamics of the system and the proposed hybrid
algorithm. Moreover, the hybrid algorithm allows each agent to estimate the
skew of its internal clock in order to allow for synchronization to a common

the timers, exponentially fast. Numerical results illustrate the

opportunities arise for applications to solve larger problems than ever before.
Given the significantly increased complexity of these HPC systems and
application tuning, empirical performance tuning, such as autotuning, has
emerged as a promising approach in recent years. Despite its effectiveness,
autotuning is often a computationally expensive approach. Transfer learning
(TL)-based autotuning seeks to address this issue by leveraging the data from
prior tuning. Current TL methods for autotuning spend significant time modeling
the relationship between parameter configurations and performance, which is
ineffective for few-shot (that is, few empirical evaluations) tuning on new
tasks. We introduce the first generative TL-based autotuning approach based on
the Gaussian copula (GC) to model the high-performing regions of the search
space from prior data and then generate high-performing configurations for new
tasks. This allows a sampling-based approach that maximizes few-shot
performance and provides the first probabilistic estimation of the few-shot
budget for effective TL-based autotuning. We compare our generative TL approach
with state-of-the-art autotuning techniques on several benchmarks. We find that
the GC is capable of achieving 64.37% of peak few-shot performance in its first
evaluation. Furthermore, the GC model can determine a few-shot transfer budget
that yields up to 33.39$\times$ speedup, a dramatic improvement over the
20.58$\times$ speedup using prior techniques.

dust spur (filament). The dust temperature of the halo component is lower than
that of the disk but increases across a region of diameter ~8.0 kpc extending
at least 7.7 kpc vertically from one side of the disk, a region we call a
superbubble because of its association with thermal X-ray emission and a
minimum in the synchrotron scaleheight. This outflow is breaking through the
thick disk and developing into a galactic wind, which is of particular interest
because NGC 891 is not considered a starburst galaxy; the star formation rate
surface density, 0.03 Msun/year per square kiloparsec, and gas fraction, just
10% in the inner disk, indicate the threshold for wind formation is lower than
previous work has suggested. We conclude that the star formation surface
density is sufficient for superbubble blowout into the halo, but the cosmic ray
electrons may play a critical role in determining whether this outflow develops
into a fountain or escapes from the gravitational potential. The high
dust-to-gas ratio in the dust spur suggests the material was pulled out of NGC
891 through the collision of a minihalo with the disk of NGC 891. We conclude
that NGC 891 offers an example of both feedback and satellite interactions
transporting dust into the halo of a typical galaxy.

(TSC) emerging as a potent solution. TSC is often modeled as a Markov Decision
Process problem and then solved using reinforcement learning (RL), which has
proven effective. However, the existing RL-based TSC system often overlooks
imperfect observations caused by degraded communication, such as packet loss,
delays, and noise, as well as rare real-life events not included in the reward
function, such as unconsidered emergency vehicles. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel integration framework that combines a large
language model (LLM) with RL. This framework is designed to manage overlooked
elements in the reward function and gaps in state information, thereby
enhancing the policies of RL agents. In our approach, RL initially makes
decisions based on observed data. Subsequently, LLMs evaluate these decisions
to verify their reasonableness. If a decision is found to be unreasonable, it
is adjusted accordingly. Additionally, this integration approach can be
seamlessly integrated with existing RL-based TSC systems without necessitating
modifications. Extensive testing confirms that our approach reduces the average
waiting time by $17.5\%$ in degraded communication conditions as compared to
traditional RL methods, underscoring its potential to advance practical RL
applications in intelligent transportation systems. The related code can be

ill-posed problem. Well-calibrated distributions of possible poses can make
these ambiguities explicit and preserve the resulting uncertainty for
downstream tasks. This study shows that previous attempts, which account for
these ambiguities via multiple hypotheses generation, produce miscalibrated
distributions. We identify that miscalibration can be attributed to the use of
sample-based metrics such as minMPJPE. In a series of simulations, we show that
minimizing minMPJPE, as commonly done, should converge to the correct mean
prediction. However, it fails to correctly capture the uncertainty, thus
resulting in a miscalibrated distribution. To mitigate this problem, we propose
an accurate and well-calibrated model called Conditional Graph Normalizing Flow

conditional and marginal densities within the same model - effectively solving
a zero-shot density estimation problem. We evaluate cGNF on the Human~3.6M

computational game theory, equilibrium finding in extensive-form team games
remains a significant challenge. While NP-hard in the worst case, there are
provably efficient algorithms for certain families of team game. In particular,
if the game has common external information, also known as A-loss recall --
informally, actions played by non-team members (i.e., the opposing team or
nature) are either unknown to the entire team, or common knowledge within the
team -- then polynomial-time algorithms exist (Kaneko & Kline 1995). In this
paper, we devise a completely new algorithm for solving team games. It uses a
tree decomposition of the constraint system representing each team's strategy
to reduce the number and degree of constraints required for correctness
(tightness of the mathematical program). Our approach has the bags of the tree
decomposition correspond to team-public states. Our algorithm reduces the
problem of solving team games to a linear program with at most $O(NW^{w+1})$
nonzero entries in the constraint matrix, where $N$ is the size of the game
tree, $w$ is a parameter that depends on the amount of uncommon external
information, and $W$ is the treewidth of the tree decomposition. In
public-action games, our program size is bounded by the tighter $2^{O(nt)}N$
for teams of $n$ players with $t$ types each. Our algorithm is based on a new
way to write a custom, concise tree decomposition, and its fast run time does
not assume that the decomposition has small treewidth. Since our algorithm
describes the polytope of correlated strategies directly, we get equilibrium
finding in correlated strategies for free -- instead of, say, having to run a
double oracle algorithm. We show via experiments on a standard suite of games
that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark game
classes except one.

investigated experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, the $g$ factor
was measured using time-resolved Faraday rotation due to Larmor precession of
electron spins in the temperature range between 4.5 K and 190 K. The experiment
shows an almost linear increase of the $g$ value with the temperature. This
result is in good agreement with other measurements based on photoluminescence
quantum beats and time-resolved Kerr rotation up to room temperature. The
experimental data are described theoretically taking into account a diminishing
fundamental energy gap in GaAs due to lattice thermal dilatation and
nonparabolicity of the conduction band calculated using a five-level kp model.
At higher temperatures electrons populate higher Landau levels and the average
$g$ factor is obtained from a summation over many levels. A very good
description of the experimental data is obtained indicating that the observed
increase of the spin $g$ factor with the temperature is predominantly due to
band's nonparabolicity.

extinction to the 3D galaxy correlation function, including magnification bias

most significant along the line of sight and at large separations, similar to
that by magnification bias. The correction from dust extinction is negative
except at sufficiently large transverse separations, which is almost always
opposite to that from magnification bias (we consider a number count slope s >
0.4). Hence, the distortions from these two effects tend to reduce each other.
At low z (~<1), the distortion by extinction is stronger than that by
magnification bias, but at high z, the reverse holds. We also study how dust
extinction affects probes in real space of the baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and the linear redshift distortion parameter beta. We find its effect on
BAO is negligible. However, it introduces a positive scale-dependent correction
to beta that can be as large as a few percent. At the same time, we also find a
negative scale-dependent correction from magnification bias, which is up to
percent level at low z, but to ~40% at high z. These corrections are
non-negligible for precision cosmology, and should be considered when testing

extended many-body systems is a difficult task. In quantum lattice models with
short-range interactions, the Lieb-Robinson bound tells us that the spatial
extent of operators grows at most linearly in time. But what happens within
this light-cone? We discuss rigorous results on ergodicity and the emergence of
the hydrodynamic scale, which establish fundamental principles at the root of
non-equilibrium physics. One key idea of the present work is that general
structures of hydrodynamics at the Euler scale follow independently from the
details of the microscopic dynamics, and in particular do not necessitate
chaos; they are consequences of ""extensivity"". Another crucial observation is
that these apply at arbitrary frequencies and wavelengths. That is, long-time
oscillatory behaviours can be reproduced from a natural extension of standard
hydrodynamic notions, thus enlarging the hydrodynamic paradigm beyond the
zero-frequency / infinite-wavelength point that it traditionally addresses.

dimension d + 1 whose boundaries are identified. The common boundary is
referred to as the junction hyperplane. The parabolic equations on the
half-hyperplanes are in non-divergence form, fully non-linear and possibly
degenerate, and they do degenerate and are quasi-convex along the junction
hyperplane. More precisely, along the junction hyperplane the non-linearities
do not depend on second order derivatives and their sublevel sets with respect
to the gradient variable are convex. The parabolic equations are supplemented
with a non-linear boundary condition of Neumann type, referred to as a
generalized junction condition, which is compatible with the maximum principle.

weak sense reduces to imposing an effective one in a strong sense. This result
extends the one obtained by Imbert and Monneau for Hamilton-Jacobi equations on

from a multi-view dataset of expressions from 2407 subjects, and leverage it as
a prior for creating personalized avatar from few-shot images. Different from
previous 3D-aware face generative models, our prior is built with a

effective for avatar creation through auto-decoding based on few-shot inputs.
We also handle unstable 3DMM fitting by jointly optimizing the 3DMM fitting and
camera calibration that leads to better few-shot adaptation. Our method
demonstrates compelling results and outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods for few-shot avatar adaptation, paving the way for more efficient and

using a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, but the Einasto profile provides an
extra degree of freedom. We thus present a comparison between two physical
models which differ only in the way they model dark matter: one which uses an
NFW profile (PM I) and one that uses an Einasto profile (PM II). We illustrate
the differences between the models by plotting physical properties of clusters
as a function of cluster radius. We generate AMI simulations of clusters which
are \textit{created} and \textit{analysed} with both models. From this we find
that for 14 of the 16 simulations, the Bayesian evidence gives no preference to
either of the models according to the Jeffreys scale, and for the other two
simulations, weak preference in favour of the correct model. However, for the
mass estimates obtained from the analyses, the values were within $1\sigma$ of
the input values for 14 out of 16 of the clusters when using the correct model,

to theoretical investigation since most approaches are accurate only when a
certain energetic parameter is small compared to others in the problem. Here we
show that in these difficult regimes, the Ehrenfest approach provides a good
starting point for a dynamical description of the energy transfer process due
to its ability to accurately treat coupling to slow environmental modes. To
further improve on the accuracy of the Ehrenfest approach, we use our reduced
density matrix hybrid framework to treat the faster environmental modes quantum
mechanically, at the level of a perturbative master equation. This combined

performance is a critical but challenging task, especially when deploying them
in real-world applications. As a common approach to reduce the size of CNNs,
pruning methods delete part of the CNN filters according to some metrics such
as $l1$-norm. However, previous methods hardly leverage the information
variance in a single feature map and the similarity characteristics among
feature maps. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning method, which
incorporates two kinds of feature map selections: diversity-aware selection
(DFS) and similarity-aware selection (SFS). DFS aims to discover features with
low information diversity while SFS removes features that have high
similarities with others. We conduct extensive empirical experiments with
various CNN architectures on publicly available datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that our model obtains up to 91.6% parameter decrease and
83.7% FLOPs reduction with almost no accuracy loss.

splitter in the Bell measurement. It is shown that in the non-unity gain regime
the signal transfer coefficient can be enhanced while the conditional variance
product remains preserved by applying appropriate local squeezing operation on
sender's part of the shared entangled state. In the unity gain regime it is
demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation can be increased with the help
of the local squeezing operations on parts of the shared entangled state that
convert effectively our scheme to the standard CV teleportation scheme.
Further, it is proved analytically that such a choice of the local symplectic
operations minimizes the noise by which the mean number of photons in the input

the local symplectic operation on sender's side can be integrated into the Bell
measurement if the interaction constant of the interaction in the Bell

highly variable data quality at client nodes. The robustness is achieved by a
denoising CycleGAN model at each client of the federation that maps arbitrary
quality images into the same target quality, counteracting the severe data
variability evident in real-world FL use-cases. Each client is provided with
the target style, which is the same for all clients, and trains their own

amyloid plaques. Our incomplete understanding of this process underscores the
need to decipher the principles governing protein aggregation. Most
experimental and simulation studies have been interpreted largely from the
perspective of proteins: the role of solvent has been relatively overlooked.
  In this Account, we provide a perspective on how interactions with water
affect folding landscapes of A$\beta$ monomers, A$\beta_{16-22}$ oligomer
formation, and protofilament formation in a Sup35 peptide. Simulations show
that the formation of aggregation-prone structures (N$^*$) similar to the
structure in the fibril requires overcoming high desolvation barrier. The
mechanism of protofilament formation in a polar Sup35 peptide fragment
illustrates that water dramatically slows down self-assembly. Release of water
trapped in the pores as water wires creates protofilament with a dry interface.
Similarly, one of the main driving force for addition of a solvated monomer to
a preformed fibril is the entropy gain of released water.
  We conclude by postulating that two-step model for protein crystallization
must also hold for higher order amyloid structure formation starting from
N$^*$. Multiple N$^*$ structures with varying water content results in a number
of distinct water-laden polymorphic structures. In predominantly hydrophobic
sequences, water accelerates fibril formation. In contrast, water-stabilized
metastable intermediates dramatically slow down fibril growth rates in
hydrophilic sequences.

impact on the differential brightness temperature, $\Delta T_{\rm b}$, a
central observable in $21$cm cosmology. Here, we introduce a semi-analytic
framework to describe the dynamics of soft photon heating, providing a
simplified set of evolution equations and a useful numerical scheme which can
be used to study this generic effect. We also perform quasi-instantaneous and
continuous soft photon injections to elucidate the different regimes in which
soft photon heating is expected to impart a significant contribution to the
global $21$cm signal and its fluctuations. We find that soft photon backgrounds
produced after recombination with spectral index $\gamma > 3.0$ undergo
significant free-free absorption, and therefore this heating effect cannot be
neglected. The effect becomes stronger with steeper spectral index, and in some
cases the injection of a synchrotron-like spectrum ($\gamma = 3.6$) can
suppress the amplitude of $\Delta T_{\rm b}$ relative to the standard model
prediction, making the global $21$cm signal even more difficult to detect in
these scenarios.

frequency and the tangent of the scaling angle, to the true scattering

without requiring any control operations during the computation process? In a

pair-interactions among qutrits on a 2D lattice are sufficient, too, and can
also implement an ergodic computer where the result can be read out from the
time average state after some post-selection with high success probability.
  Two of the 3 qutrit states are given by the two levels of a spin-1/2 particle
located at a specific lattice site, the third state is its absence. Usual
hopping terms together with an attractive force among adjacent particles induce
a coupled quantum walk where the particle spins are subjected to spatially
inhomogeneous interactions implementing holonomic quantum computing. The
holonomic method ensures that the implemented circuit does not depend on the

clusters by their pseudo-labels, our contrastive regularization updates the
model so that the features with confident pseudo-labels aggregate the features
in the same cluster, while pushing away features in different clusters. As a
result, the information of confident pseudo-labels can be effectively
propagated into more unlabeled samples during training by the well-clustered
features. On benchmarks of semi-supervised learning tasks, our contrastive
regularization improves the previous consistency-based methods and achieves
state-of-the-art results, especially with fewer training iterations. Our method

liking, sharing, downloading or creating new videos (outflow) to estimate
contagion. To validate our approach and analysis, we obtain human feedback on
these 48 social media platform users with an online study by collecting
responses of about 150 participants. We report users who interact with more

respectively. The Halpha line of HL Aqr shows significant blueshifted
absorption modulated at the orbital period. Similarly to the emission S-wave of
the high-inclination SW Sex stars, this absorption S-wave has its maximum blue
velocity at orbital phase ~0.5. We estimate an orbital inclination for HL Aqr
in the range 19 < i < 27 deg, which is much lower than that of the
emission-dominated, non-eclipsing SW Sex stars (i ~ 60-70 deg). This gives rise
to the interesting possibility of many low-inclination nova-likes actually
being SW Sex stars, but with a very different spectroscopic appearance as they
show significant absorption. The increasing blueshifted absorption with
decreasing inclination points to the existence of a mass outflow with
significant vertical motion. This six new additions to the SW Sex class
increase the presence of non-eclipsing systems to about one third of the whole
SW Sex population, which therefore makes the requirement of eclipses as a

in recent years, their learned policies can be brittle, failing to generalize

The black-box nature of the neural network learning dynamics makes it
impossible to audit trained deep agents and recover from such failures. In this
paper, we propose a novel representation and learning approach to capture
environment dynamics without using neural networks. It originates from the
observation that, in games designed for people, the effect of an action can
often be perceived in the form of local changes in consecutive visual
observations. Our algorithm is designed to extract such vision-based changes
and condense them into a set of action-dependent descriptive rules, which we
call ''visual rewrite rules'' (VRRs). We also present preliminary results from
a VRR agent that can explore, expand its rule set, and solve a game via
planning with its learned VRR world model. In several classical games, our
non-deep agent demonstrates superior performance, extreme sample efficiency,
and robust generalization ability compared with several mainstream deep agents.

excitons in TMDCs have been heavily studied, their behavior in the quantum
tunneling regime, in which the TMDC or its heterostructure is optically excited
and concurrently serves as a tunnel junction barrier, remains unexplored. Here,
using the degree of freedom of a metallic probe in an atomic force microscope,
we investigated both intralayer and interlayer excitons dynamics in TMDC
heterobilayers via locally controlled junction current in a finely tuned

measurements reveal a significantly different exciton-quantum plasmon coupling
for intralayer and interlayer excitons due to different orientation of the

extracted field gradients, radiative and nonradiative relaxation rates for
excitons in the quantum tunneling regime with and without junction current. Our
results show that tip-induced radiative (nonradiative) relaxation of intralayer

plasticity of crystalline solids treated as a material flow through an
adjustable crystal lattice space. The model is based on the additive splitting
of the velocity gradient into the crystal lattice part and the plastic part.
The approach extends a Gibbs-potential-based formulation developed by Rajagopal
and Srinivasa for obtaining the response functions for elasto-visco-plastic
crystals. The framework makes constitutive assumptions for two scalar
functions: the Gibbs potential and the rate of dissipation. The constitutive
equations relating the stress to kinematical quantities is then determined
using the condition that the rate of dissipation is maximal providing that the
relevant constraints are met. The proposed model is applied to
three-dimensional micropillar compression, and its features, both on the level
of modelling and computer simulations, are discussed and compared to relevant
studies.

the LEPS spectrometer via its decay to $p\pi^-$ and the K^+ was inferred using
the technique of missing mass. These measurements, corresponding to kaons at

the proximity to the host star. Our analysis considers errors in planet radii

find a radius distribution that peaks at 2-2.8 Earth radii, with lower numbers
of smaller and larger planets. These planets are uniformly distributed with
logarithmic period, and the mean number of such planets per star is $0.46 \pm

community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge
deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional
vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their
ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the
impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively
understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods
from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random
walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on
both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of
robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is
found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community
partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE
consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across
different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size
heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an
appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the
network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to
perturbations is crucial.

collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE), focusing on the coarse-grained approach
towards equilibrium. The CBE is a noncanonical Hamiltonian system with the
distribution function f the fundamental dynamical variable, the mean field
energy H[f] playing the role of the Hamiltonian and the natural arena of
physics being the infinite-dimensional phase space of distribution functions.
Every time-independent equilibrium f_0 is an energy extremal with respect to
all perturbations that preserve the constraints associated with Liouville's
Theorem, local energy minima corresponding to linearly stable equilibria. If an
initial f(t=0) is sufficiently close to some linearly stable lower energy f_0,
its evolution involves linear phase space oscillations about f_0 which, in many
cases, would be expected to exhibit linear Landau damping. If f(t=0) is far
from any stable extremal, the flow will be more complicated but, in general,
one would anticipate that the evolution involves nonlinear oscillations about
some lower energy f_0. In this picture, the coarse-grained approach towards
equilibrium usually termed violent relaxation is interpreted as nonlinear
Landau damping. The evolution of a generic initial f(t=0) involves a coherent
initial excitation, not necessarily small, being converted into incoherent
motion associated with nonlinear oscillations about some equilibrium f_0 which,
in general, will exhibit destructive interference.

is the differential entropy rate. The rate of convergence of many properties of
LRD processes is slower than might be expected, based on the intuition for
conventional processes, e.g. Markov processes. Is this also true of the entropy
rate?
  In this paper we consider the properties of the differential entropy rate of
stochastic processes that have an autocorrelation function that decays as a
power law. We show that power law decaying processes with similar
autocorrelation and spectral density functions, Fractional Gaussian Noise and
ARFIMA(0,d,0), have different entropic properties, particularly for negatively
correlated parameterisations. Then we provide an equivalence between the mutual
information between past and future and the differential excess entropy for
stationary Gaussian processes, showing the finiteness of this quantity is the
boundary between long and short range dependence. Finally, we analyse the
convergence of the conditional entropy to the differential entropy rate and
show that for short range dependence that the rate of convergence is of the
order $O(n^{-1})$, but it is slower for long range dependent processes and
depends on the Hurst parameter.

possible to learn agent behaviors without interacting with the environment.
However, depending on the quality of the offline dataset, such pre-trained
agents may have limited performance and would further need to be fine-tuned
online by interacting with the environment. During online fine-tuning, the
performance of the pre-trained agent may collapse quickly due to the sudden
distribution shift from offline to online data. While constraints enforced by
offline RL methods such as a behaviour cloning loss prevent this to an extent,
these constraints also significantly slow down online fine-tuning by forcing
the agent to stay close to the behavior policy. We propose to adaptively weigh
the behavior cloning loss during online fine-tuning based on the agent's
performance and training stability. Moreover, we use a randomized ensemble of Q
functions to further increase the sample efficiency of online fine-tuning by
performing a large number of learning updates. Experiments show that the
proposed method yields state-of-the-art offline-to-online reinforcement
learning performance on the popular D4RL benchmark. Code is available:

relies on spontaneous emission to induce occasional transitions between
positive and negative phase shifts---with each such edge corresponding to a
dissipated energy of just one photon ($\approx 0.23$ aJ)---but an optical
control beam could be used to trigger additional phase switching at signalling
rates above this background. Although our ability to demonstrate controlled

exploiting analogous physics in a nanophotonic device incorporating a quantum
dot as the TLS to realize deterministic binary phase modulation with control
power in the aJ/edge regime.

region with uniform energy density. Gibbons, Hawking and York showed that
fixing the induced boundary metric yields a well-posed variational problem.
However, as we demonstrate, fixing the boundary metric violates general
covariance and allows the mass of a back hole to vary. This observation has
dramatic consequences for path integrals: A sum over spacetimes with fixed
boundary metrics is a sum over classically distinct black holes. Instead, we
merely demand that coordinates exist such that the metric at the boundary is
the Schwarzschild-(A)dS metric of fixed mass M and two-sphere radius R. We
derive the action that yields a well-posed variational problem for these
physical boundary conditions. The action vanishes for all stationary and
isotropic spacetimes. A vanishing action implies that both a Schwarzschild
black hole and pure de Sitter space each have one unique semiclassical state.
Our results provide a novel and radically conservative approach to several
long-standing issues in quantum gravity, such as the wavefunction of the
universe, the black hole information paradox, vacuum decay rates and the

clear dependence on the radius, with internal regions more relaxed than
outskirts. The morphology from multi-wavelength mock observation of clusters in
X-ray, optical, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect images, is quantified by $M$
-- a combination of six parameters for X-ray and SZ maps and the offsets
between the optical position of the Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) and the
X-ray/SZ centroids. All the morphological parameters are highly correlated with
each other, while they show a moderately strong correlation with the dynamical

state than centroids, which results in reliable tracers of the cluster density
peak. The principal source of contamination in the relaxed cluster fraction,
inferred from morphological parameters, is due to dynamically hybrid clusters.

FabSearch utilizes meta-data about each part, such as material specification,
tolerance requirements to help improve the search results based on the specific

subsonic jet of gas impinges vertically on a bed of sand or lunar soil simulant
forming a localized scour hole beneath the jet. Videography captures the
erosion and scour hole formation processes, and analysis of these videos
post-test identifies the scaling of these processes. This has produced
important new insights into the physics of erosion. Based on these insights, we
have developed an erosion rate model that can be applied to generalized
situations, such as the erosion of soil beneath a horizontal gas flow on a
planetary surface. This is important to lunar exploration because the rate of
erosion beneath the rocket exhaust plume of a landing spacecraft will determine
the amount of sand-blasting damage that can be inflicted upon surrounding
hardware. Although the rocket exhaust plume at the exit of the nozzle is
supersonic, the boundary layer on the lunar surface where erosion occurs is
subsonic. The model has been benchmarked through comparison with the Apollo

briefly introduced in Lemaire (1995) and Pitrebois et al. (2003a).
Specifically, such a BMS extends the number of Bonus-Malus (BM) levels due to
an additional component in the transition rules representing the number of
consecutive claim-free years. With the extended BM levels granting more
reasonable bonus to careful drivers, this paper investigates the transition
rules in a more rigorous manner, and provides the optimal BM relativities under
various statistical model assumptions including the frequency random effect
model and the dependent collective risk model. Also, numerical analysis of a
real data set is provided to compare the classical BMS and our proposed BMS.

available data has no local maxima. This enables us to use the causal
expectation-maximisation scheme to approximate the bounds for partially

show how the same approach can address the general case of multiple datasets,
no matter whether interventional or observational, biased or unbiased, by
remapping it into the former one via graphical transformations. Systematic
numerical experiments and a case study on palliative care show the
effectiveness of our approach, while hinting at the benefits of fusing
heterogeneous data sources to get informative outcomes in case of partial

to comprehend the limitations of this Low Power Wide Area Network technology.
Previous work has raised questions in terms of the scalability and capacity of
LoRaWAN networks as the number of end devices grows to hundreds or thousands
per gateway. Some works have modeled LoRaWAN networks as pure ALOHA networks,
which fails to capture important characteristics such as the capture effect and
the effects of interference. Other works provide a more comprehensive model by
relying on empirical and stochastic techniques. This work uses a different
approach where a LoRa error model is constructed from extensive complex
baseband bit error rate simulations and used as an interference model. The
error model is combined with the LoRaWAN MAC protocol in an ns-3 module that
enables to study multi channel, multi spreading factor, multi gateway,
bi-directional LoRaWAN networks with thousands of end devices. Using the
lorawan ns-3 module, a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN shows the detrimental
impact of downstream traffic on the delivery ratio of confirmed upstream
traffic. The analysis shows that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but
not eliminate this effect, as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways
continue to limit downstream opportunities.

planning of infrastructure investments and operations serving multiple end-uses
while considering technology and policy-enabled interactions across sectors.
Electricity and natural gas (NG), which are vital vectors of today's energy
system, are likely to be coupled in different ways in the future, resulting
from increasing electrification, adoption of variable renewable energy (VRE)
generation in the power sector and policy factors such as cross-sectoral
emissions trading. This paper develops a least-cost investment and operations
model for joint planning of electricity and NG infrastructures that considers a
wide range of available and emerging technology options across the two vectors,
including carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipped power generation,
low-carbon drop-in fuels (LCDF) as well as long-duration energy storage (LDES).
The model incorporates the main operational constraints of both systems and
allows each system to operate under different temporal resolutions consistent
with their typical scheduling timescales. We apply the modeling framework to
evaluate power-NG system outcomes for the U.S. New England region under
different technology, decarbonization goals, and demand scenarios. Under a
global emissions constraint, ranging between 80-95\% emissions reduction
compared to 1990 levels, the least-cost solution disproportionately relies on
using the available emissions budget to serve non-power NG demand and results
in the power sector using only 15-43\% of the emissions budget.

swimmers. This minimal experimental system is isotropic at rest, a symmetry
that can be spontaneously broken due to the nonlinear coupling between

to different propulsive modes. We report a dynamical transition from
quasi-ballistic to bimodal chaotic motion, controlled by the viscosity of the
swimming medium. By simultaneous visualisation of the chemical and hydrodynamic
fields, supported quantitatively by an advection-diffusion model, we show that
higher hydrodynamic modes become excitable with increasing viscosity, while the
recurrent mode-switching is driven by the droplet's interaction with
self-generated chemical gradients. We further demonstrate that this gradient
interaction results in anomalous diffusive swimming akin to self-avoiding
spatial exploration strategies observed in nature.

their fundamental plane. It is confirmed that residuals in the Tully-Fisher
relation are correlated with surface brightness, but that even after
accommodating the surface brightness dependence through the dwarf fundamental
plane, residuals in absolute magnitude are far larger than expected from
observational errors. Rather, a more fundamental plane is identified which
connects the potential to HI line width and surface brightness. Residuals
correlate with the axis ratio in a way which can be accommodated by recognizing
the galaxies to be oblate spheroids viewed at varying angles. Correction of
surface brightnesses to face-on leads to a correlation among the potential,
line width, and surface brightness for which residuals are entirely
attributable to observational uncertainties. The mean mass-to-light ratio of
the diffuse component of the galaxies is constrained to be 0.88 +/- 0.20 in Ks.
Blue compact dwarfs lie in the same plane as dwarf irregulars. The dependence
of the potential on line width is less strong than expected for virialized
systems, but this may be because surface brightness is acting as a proxy for
variations in the mass-to-light ratio from galaxy to galaxy. Altogether, the
observations suggest that gas motions are predominantly disordered and
isotropic, that they are a consequence of gravity, not turbulence, and that the
mass and scale of dark matter haloes scale with the amount and distribution of
luminous matter. The tight relationship between the potential and observables
offers the promise of determining distances to unresolved star-forming dwarfs
to an accuracy comparable to that provided by the Tully-Fisher relation for
spirals.

formulate the problem as a two-player zero sum game against an adversarial

still accurately predicting the transitions in the dataset, forcing the policy
to act conservatively in areas not covered by the dataset. To approximately
solve the two-player game, we alternate between optimising the policy and
adversarially optimising the model. The problem formulation that we address is
theoretically grounded, resulting in a probably approximately correct (PAC)
performance guarantee and a pessimistic value function which lower bounds the
value function in the true environment. We evaluate our approach on widely
studied offline RL benchmarks, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines.

to ask about the relationship between inverse problems defined by the original
problem and by the multiscale approximation. We develop an approach to this
problem and exemplify it in the context of optical tomographic imaging.
  Optical tomographic imaging is a technique for infering the properties of
biological tissue via measurements of the incoming and outgoing light
intensity; it may be used as a medical imaging methodology. Mathematically,
light propagation is modeled by the radiative transfer equation (RTE), and
optical tomography amounts to reconstructing the scattering and the absorption
coefficients in the RTE from boundary measurements. We study this problem in
the Bayesian framework, focussing on the strong scattering regime. In this
regime the forward RTE is close to the diffusion equation (DE). We study the
RTE in the asymptotic regime where the forward problem approaches the DE, and
prove convergence of the inverse RTE to the inverse DE in both nonlinear and
linear settings. Convergence is proved by studying the distance between the two
posterior distributions using the Hellinger metric, and using Kullback-Leibler
divergence.

problems.
  Nevertheless, efficient and greedy point-selection strategies are known. This
paper gives a proof of the convergence rate of the data-independent
\textit{$P$-greedy} algorithm, based on the application of the convergence
theory for greedy algorithms in reduced basis methods. The resulting rate of
convergence is shown to be near-optimal in the case of kernels generating

It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray
burst (GRB) and a type Ib/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of
induced gravitational collapse (IGC), induced by the matter ejected from an SN
Ib/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected to reach the
critical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB.
We found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray
emission of this subclass of GRBs. Aims. We test if this standard behavior in
the luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become a redshift estimator
of these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this
subclass of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources
have an isotropic energy $E_{iso} > 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological
redshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused on the corresponding
X-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample
with measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in
the $0.3-10$ keV rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the
GRB redshift of the sample without a measured redshift and found results
consistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions. The standard
late-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common
physical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly
related to the creation of the NS from the SN process. This scaling law
moreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent beaming in this
late phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process. This could be a fundamental
tool for estimating the redshift of GRBs that belong to this subclass of
events. We are currently expanding this subclass of GRBs to further verify the
universal validity of this new redshift estimation method.

boundary conditions for finite difference approximations of evolution
equations. We try to keep the discussion at the highest level of generality in
order to apply the theory to the broadest class of problems. We deal with two
main issues. We first derive transparent numerical boundary conditions, that
is, we exhibit the relations satisfied by the solution to the pure Cauchy
problem when the initial condition vanishes outside of some domain. Our
derivation encompasses discretized transport, diffusion and dispersive
equations with arbitrarily wide stencils. The second issue is to prove sharp
stability estimates for the initial boundary value problem obtained by
enforcing the boundary conditions derived in the first step. We focus here on
discretized transport equations. Under the assumption that the numerical
boundary is non-characteristic, our main result characterizes the class of
numerical schemes for which the corresponding transparent boundary conditions
satisfy the so-called Uniform Kreiss-Lopatinskii Condition introduced in
[GKS72]. Adapting some previous works to the non-local boundary conditions
considered here, our analysis culminates in the derivation of trace and
semigroup estimates for such transparent numerical boundary conditions. Several
examples and possible extensions are given.

$T=0$ has been extended to describe the statistical mechanics of interacting
bosons at finite temperature. We show explicitly that the field-theoretic
calculation of the grand partition function in this formulation amounts to a
canonical trace over the eigenfunctions of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian at fixed
total number of bosons $N$, and that the additional trace over $N$ that is
required in the grand-canonical formalism is never carried out. This implies
that what usually passes as the grand-canonical treatment of the Bogoliubov
Hamiltonian is not quite grand-canonical, and is in fact a canonical one. We
also show that the discontinuity in the condensate density predicted by
previous formulations of this theory as the temperature $T$ goes past the
critical transition temperature $T_c$ is a direct consequence of an
inappropriate generalization of the Bogoliubov prescription to finite
temperatures, and that this discontinuity disappears when this prescription is
either used as a zero temperature approximation or avoided altogether. Armed
with the above findings, we reformulate the statistical mechanics of
interacting bosons in the canonical ensemble and derive the thermodynamics of
the system. We then show how the canonical treatment can be used to setup a
truly grand-canonical description of the statistical mechanics of a weakly
interacting Bose gas where the average number of bosons in the system varies
with temperature, unlike existing formulations where the total number of bosons
$N$ is taken to be a constant that does not depend on $T$. Consequences on the
physics of interacting bosons are briefly discussed.

paper presents a hybrid event detection approach for relatively complex

a base algorithm based on moving average change with time limit, and two

different datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach in comparison with several existing approaches including log

We analyze scenarios in which not only the underlying network structure
(parental relationships and link strengths) needs to be detected, but also the
infection times must be estimated. We assume that our only observation of the
diffusion process is a set of time series, one for each node of the network,
which exhibit changepoints when an infection occurs. After formulating a model
to describe the contagion, and selecting appropriate prior distributions, we
seek to find the set of model parameters that best explains our observations.

duality. Non-relativistically, the only conservation law relevant to the
hydrodynamic approximation is the energy-momentum conservation.
Relativistically, one has to introduce an extra conserved U(1) current and an
extra three-dimensional scalar field which is condensed. Finding out a proper
U(1) symmetry becomes a crucial point. We emphasize that in dual models there
do arise extra U(1) symmetries associated with wrapping of the strings around
(extra) compact directions in Euclidean space-time. Moreover, if the geometry
associated with an extra compact dimension is cigar-like then the corresponding
U(1) symmetry could well be spontaneously broken. The emerging Goldstone
particle survives in the hydrodynamic limit. A specific point is that the
chemical potential conjugated with the corresponding U(1) charge is vanishing.
Within the standard approach the vanishing chemical potential implies no
superfluidity. We argue that an exotic liquid, introduced recently in the
literature, with vanishing energy density and non-vanishing pressure represents
a viable description of the liquid associated with 3d Goldstone particles in
Euclidean space-time. Since it lives on the stretched membrane, it describes
energy-momentum transport in the deep infrared. We discuss briefly possible
applications to the quark-gluon plasma.

redshifts, a moderate amount of DM particle decay remains a valid possibility.
This includes both models with very long-lived yet unstable particles or mixed
scenarios where only a small fraction of dark matter is allowed to decay. In
this paper, we investigate how DM particles decaying into radiation affect
non-linear structure formation. We look at the power spectrum and its redshift
evolution, varying both the decay lifetime ($\tau$) and the fraction of
decaying-to-total dark matter ($f$), and we propose a fitting function that
reaches sub-percent precision below $k\sim10$ h/Mpc. Based on this fit, we
perform a forecast analysis for a Euclid-like weak lensing (WL) survey,
including both massive neutrino and baryonic feedback parameters. We find that
with WL observations alone, it is possible to rule out decay lifetimes smaller
than $\tau=75$ Gyr (at 95 percent CL) for the case that all DM is unstable.
This constraint improves to $\tau=182$ Gyr if the WL data is combined with CMB
priors from the Planck satellite and to $\tau=275$ Gyr if we further assume
baryonic feedback to be fully constrained by upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich or
X-ray data. The latter shows a factor of 3.2 improvement compared to
constraints from CMB data alone. Regarding the scenario of a strongly decaying
sub-component of dark matter with $\tau\sim 30$ Gyr or lower, it will be
possible to rule out a decaying-to-total fraction of $f>0.49$, $f>0.21$, and
$f>0.13$ (at the 95 percent CL) for the same three scenarios. We conclude that
the upcoming stage-IV WL surveys will allow us to significantly improve current

homogeneously planar and homeotropic aligned cells using dielectric
spectroscopy in the frequency range 0.1 Hz to 10 MHz over a wide range of
temperatures. Three relaxation processes are identified in this material. All
the three relaxation processes show large jumps in the dielectric strength and
discontinuity in frequency at the NX to NF transition, indicative of it being a
first order phase transition. Unlike a conventional nematic liquid crystalline
material that usually shows molecular relaxation processes at higher
frequencies, this material shows three processes at relatively lower
frequencies. The three processes are found to be collective in nature. The
least frequency process is proven to be due to the conductivity of ions in the
medium and due to the accumulation of charge at the alignment layers unlike
mistakenly reported in the literature otherwise. The mode at the highest
frequency is proven to be due to the ferroelectric domains in the NF phase.
This is evidenced by its dielectric strength two orders of magnitude higher in
a homeotropic aligned cell than planar aligned cell. Its mechanism is soft mode
like in the N phase. The intermediate frequency mode is proven to be due to the
correlation of molecules of the medium as is normally observed in liquid
crystalline cybotactic clusters.

symbols yields an interesting modeling language. However, satisfiability of
such formulas is undecidable, even if we restrict the uninterpreted predicate
symbols to arity one. In order to find decidable fragments of this language, it
is necessary to restrict the expressiveness of the arithmetic part. One
possible path is to confine arithmetic expressions to difference constraints of
the form $x - y \mathrel{\#} c$, where $\#$ ranges over the standard relations
$<, \leq, =, \neq, \geq, >$ and $x,y$ are universally quantified. However, it
is known that combining difference constraints with uninterpreted predicate
symbols yields an undecidable satisfiability problem again. In this paper, it
is shown that satisfiability becomes decidable if we in addition bound the
ranges of universally quantified variables. As bounded intervals over the reals
still comprise infinitely many values, a trivial instantiation procedure is not
sufficient to solve the problem.

collisions, continuum emission from galaxies and scattering of Lyman-n photons
in the IGM. We find that the emission from individual galaxies dominates over
the IGM with a total Lyman-alpha intensity (times frequency) of about
(1.43-3.57)x10^{-8} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} at a redshift of 7. This
intensity level is low so it is unlikely that the Lyman-\alpha background
during reionization can be established by an experiment aiming at an absolute
background light measurement. Instead we consider Lyman-\alpha intensity
mapping with the aim of measuring the anisotropy power spectrum which has rms
fluctuations at the level of 1 x 10^{-16} [erg s^[-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}]^2 at a
few Mpc scales. These anisotropies could be measured with a spectrometer at
near-IR wavelengths from 0.9 to 1.4 \mu m with fields in the order of 0.5 to 1

due to their coupling to quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. This
can be precisely worked out in 3d quantum gravity: after integrating out
quantum gravity, matter fields are effectively described as noncommutative
quantum field theories, with quantum-deformed Lorentz symmetries. An open
question remains: Are such theories unitary or not? On the one hand, since
these are effective field theories obtained after integrating out high energy
degrees of freedom, we may expect the loss of unitarity. On the other hand, as
rigorously defined field theories built with Lorentz symmetries and standing on
their own, we naturally expect the conservation of unitarity. In an effort to
settle this issue, we explicitly check unitarity for a scalar field at one-loop
level in both Euclidean and Lorentzian space-time signatures. We find that
unitarity requires adding an extra-term to the propagator of the noncommutative
theory, corresponding to a massless mode and given by a representation with
vanishing Plancherel measure, thus usually ignored in spinfoam path integrals
for quantum gravity. This indicates that the inclusion of matter in spinfoam
models, and more generally in quantum gravity, might be more subtle than
previously thought.

however to be shielded from the deleterious effects of the environment. While
dynamical decoupling techniques can improve the coherence time, they impose a
compromise between sensitivity and bandwidth, since to higher decoupling power
correspond higher frequencies of the field to be measured. Moreover, the
performance of pulse sequences is ultimately limited by control bounds and
errors. Here we analyze a versatile alternative based on continuous driving. We
find that continuous dynamical decoupling schemes can be used for AC

active nematic fluid. We find that the drag on the particle is non-Stokesian
(not proportional to its radius). Strikingly, a large enough particle in
contractile fluid (such as an actomyosin gel) can show negative viscous drag in
steady state: the particle moves in the opposite direction to the externally
applied force. We explain this, and the qualitative trends seen in our
simulations, in terms of the disruption of orientational order around the probe
particle and the resulting modifications to the active stress.

finite-disorder critical point of the Random-field Ising model (RFIM) has the
peculiarity to involve some 'droplet' exponent $\theta$ that enters the
generalized hyperscaling relation $2-\alpha= \nu (d-\theta)$. In the present
paper, to better understand the meaning of this droplet exponent $\theta$
beyond its role in the thermodynamics, we discuss the statistics of low-energy
excitations generated by an imposed single spin-flip with respect to the ground
state, as well as the statistics of equilibrium avalanches i.e. the
magnetization jumps that occur in the sequence of ground-states as a function
of the external magnetic field. The droplet scaling theory predicts that the
distribution $dl/l^{1+\theta}$ of the linear-size $l$ of low-energy excitations
transforms into the distribution $ds/s^{1+{\theta/d_f}}$ for the size $s$
(number of spins) of excitations of fractal dimension $d_f$ ($s \sim l^{d_f}$).
In the non-mean-field region $d<d_c$, droplets are compact $d_f=d$, whereas in
the mean-field region $d>d_c$, droplets have a fractal dimension $d_f=2 \theta$
leading to the well-known mean-field result $ds/s^{3/2}$. Zero-field
equilibrium avalanches are expected to display the same distribution
$ds/s^{1+{\theta/d_f}}$. We also discuss the statistics of equilibrium
avalanches integrated over the external field and finite-size behaviors. These
expectations are checked numerically for the Dyson hierarchical version of the
RFIM, where the droplet exponent $\theta(\sigma)$ can be varied as a function
of the effective long-range interaction $J(r) \sim 1/r^{d+\sigma}$ in $d=1$.

jobs. Accordingly, effective batch job scheduling is crucial to obtain high
system efficiency. Existing HPC batch job schedulers typically leverage
heuristic priority functions to prioritize and schedule jobs. But, once
configured and deployed by the experts, such priority functions can hardly
adapt to the changes of job loads, optimization goals, or system settings,
potentially leading to degraded system efficiency when changes occur. To
address this fundamental issue, we present RLScheduler, an automated HPC batch
job scheduler built on reinforcement learning. RLScheduler relies on minimal
manual interventions or expert knowledge, but can learn high-quality scheduling
policies via its own continuous 'trial and error'. We introduce a new
kernel-based neural network structure and trajectory filtering mechanism in
RLScheduler to improve and stabilize the learning process. Through extensive
evaluations, we confirm that RLScheduler can learn high-quality scheduling
policies towards various workloads and various optimization goals with
relatively low computation cost. Moreover, we show that the learned models
perform stably even when applied to unseen workloads, making them practical for
production use.

investigate the universal properties of excess charges accumulated near the

the earlier observed linear dependence of the boundary charge on the phase of
the periodic potential modulation as well as extend these results to the
interface model. The linear dependence on the phase shows a universal value for
the slope, and is intersected by discontinuous jumps by plus or minus one
electron charge at the phase points where localized states enter or leave a
band of extended states. Both contributions add up such that the periodicity of
the excess charge in the phase over a $2\pi$-cycle is maintained. While in the

localized state contributions to the total interface charge is unveiled on the

modes, the full response function from the time delay interferometry (TDI) and
the gaussian likelihood function with the dynamic nested parameter sampler. In
particular, we highlight the role of higher-order modes. By including these
modes, the luminosity distance estimation precision can be improved roughly by
a factor of 50, compared with the case with only the leading order

break the distance-inclination degeneracy. Furthermore, we show the robustness

(STCMT), capable of elegantly capturing the key features of the resonant

demonstrating that this tool offers a powerful semi-analytical framework to

remove artificially added noise while imposing data consistency to reconstruct
the underlying images. However, real-world MRI acquisitions already contain
inherent noise due to thermal fluctuations. This phenomenon is particularly
notable when using ultra-fast, high-resolution imaging sequences for advanced
research, or using low-field systems favored by low- and middle-income
countries. These common scenarios can lead to sub-optimal performance or
complete failure of existing diffusion model-based reconstruction techniques.
Specifically, as the artificially added noise is gradually removed, the
inherent MRI noise becomes increasingly pronounced, making the actual noise
level inconsistent with the predefined denoising schedule and consequently
inaccurate image reconstruction. To tackle this problem, we propose a posterior
sampling strategy with a novel NoIse Level Adaptive Data Consistency (Nila-DC)
operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and an
in-house clinical dataset with field strength ranging from 0.3T to 3T, showing
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, and
is highly robust against various noise levels. The code for Nila is available

properties of the central black hole, in particular `trapped inertial waves'
(r-modes), offer an attractive explanation for HFQPOs. To produce an observable
signature, however, such oscillations must be excited to sufficiently large
amplitudes. Turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) fails
to provide the necessary amplification, but r-modes may still be excited via
interaction with accretion disc warps or eccentricities. We present 3D global

non-minimally coupled massive vector fields with a potential term. This model
is similar to the model of chaotic inflation with scalar fields, except that
for vector fields the isotropy of expansion is achieved either by considering a
triplet of orthogonal vector fields or $N$ randomly oriented independent vector
fields. We introduce a new version of vector inflation where the vector field
has no potential term but is non-minimally coupled to gravity through the
kinetic term. The non-minimal coupling is established by introducing the
Einstein tensor besides the metric tensor within the kinetic term of the vector
field.

sporadic occultation of stellar light by circumstellar dust. GM\,Cephei is such
a UXor in the young ($\sim4$~Myr) open cluster Trumpler\,37, showing prominent
infrared excess, emission-line spectra, and flare activity. Our photometric
monitoring (2008--2018) detects (1)~an $\sim$3.43~day period, likely arising
from rotational modulation by surface starspots, (2)~sporadic brightening on
time scales of days due to accretion, (3)~irregular minor flux drops due to
circumstellar dust extinction, and (4)~major flux drops, each lasting for a
couple of months with a recurrence time, though not exactly periodic, of about
two years. The star experiences normal reddening by large grains, i.e., redder
when dimmer, but exhibits an unusual ""blueing"" phenomenon in that the star
turns blue near brightness minima. The maximum extinction during relatively
short (lasting $\leq 50$~days) events, is proportional to the duration, a
consequence of varying clump sizes. For longer events, the extinction is
independent of duration, suggestive of a transverse string distribution of
clumps. Polarization monitoring indicates an optical polarization varying
$\sim3\%$--8$\%$, with the level anticorrelated with the slow brightness
change. Temporal variation of the unpolarized and polarized light sets
constraints on the size and orbital distance of the circumstellar clumps in the
interplay with the young star and scattering envelope. These transiting clumps
are edge-on manifestations of the ring- or spiral-like structures found
recently in young stars with imaging in infrared of scattered light, or in
submillimeter of thermalized dust emission.

supermassive or intermediate mass black hole - such as those in the Galactic
centre or in the centre of Globular clusters - would allow for precision tests
of general relativity (GR) in the strong-field, non-linear regime. We present a
framework for calculating the theoretical time-frequency signal from a PSR in
such an Extreme Mass Ratio Binary (EMRB). This framework is entirely
relativistic with no weak-field approximations and so able to account for all
higher-order strong-field gravitational effects, relativistic spin dynamics,
the convolution with astrophysical effects and the combined impact on the PSR
timing signal. Specifically we calculate both the spacetime path of the pulsar
radio signal and the complex orbital and spin dynamics of a spinning pulsar
around a Kerr black hole, accounting for spacetime curvature and frame
dragging, relativistic and gravitational time delay, gravitational light
bending, temporal and spatial dispersion induced by the presence of plasma
along the line of sight and relativistic aberration. This then allows for a
consistent time-frequency solution to be generated. Such a framework is key for
assessing the use of PSR as probes of strong field GR, helping to inform the
detection of an EMRB system hosting a PSR and, most essentially, for providing
an accurate theoretical basis to then compare with observations to test
fundamental physics.

diagnostics of the geometry and kinematics of the ``Little Homunculus'' (LH)
growing inside the larger Homunculus nebula. The LH expansion is not perfectly
homologous: while low-latitudes are consistent with linear expansion since
1910, the polar caps imply ejection dates around 1920--1930. However, the
expansion speed of the LH is slower than the post-eruption wind, so the star's
powerful wind may accelerate it. With an initial ejection speed of 200 km/s in
1890, the LH would have been accelerated to its present speed if the mass is
roughly 0.1 Msun. This agrees with an independent estimate of the LH mass based
on its density and volume. In any case, an ejection after 1930 is ruled out.
Using the LH as a probe of the 1890 event, then, it is evident that its most
basic physical parameters (total mass and kinetic energy; 0.1 Msun and 10^46.9
ergs, respectively) are orders of magnitude less than during the giant eruption
in the 1840s. Thus, the ultimate energy sources were different for these two
events -- yet their ejecta have the same bipolar geometry. This clue may point
toward a collimation mechanism separate from the underlying causes of the
outbursts.

imperceptible to human observers. We urgently need a multitude of universal and
transferable prompts to improve the safety of image generators, especially
black-box-released APIs. Nevertheless, they are constrained by labor-intensive
design processes and heavily reliant on the quality of the given instructions.
To achieve this, we introduce a black-box stealthy prompt attack (BSPA) that
adopts a retriever to simulate attacks from API users. It can effectively
harness filter scores to tune the retrieval space of sensitive words for
matching the input prompts, thereby crafting stealthy prompts tailored for
image generators. Significantly, this approach is model-agnostic and requires
no internal access to the model's features, ensuring its applicability to a
wide range of image generators. Building on BSPA, we have constructed an
automated prompt tool and a comprehensive prompt attack dataset (NSFWeval).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSPA effectively explores the security
vulnerabilities in a variety of state-of-the-art available black-box models,
including Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2/3. Furthermore, we

benchmark suites often consist of numerous fixed test functions, making it
challenging to align these with specific research objectives, such as the

single-objective, box-constrained, continuous numerical optimization. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on multiple baseline functions and

in the local Universe. Here we present a first look at 6 galaxies observed for
the Nearby Galaxy Showcase as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations
acquired between August and November, 2023. These targets, 3 dwarf galaxies
(HolmbergII, IC10, NGC6822) and 3 spirals (IC342, NGC2403, NGC6744), range in
distance from about 0.5 Mpc to 8.8 Mpc. Our assessment of the surface
brightness depths in the stacked Euclid images confirms previous estimates in
100 arcsec^2 regions of 1sigma=30.5 mag/arcsec^2 for VIS, but slightly deeper
than previous estimates for NISP with 1sigma=29.2-29.4 mag/arcsec^2. By
combining Euclid HE, YE, and IE into RGB images, we illustrate the large
field-of-view covered by a single Reference Observing Sequence, together with
exquisite detail on parsec scales in these nearby galaxies. Radial surface
brightness and color profiles demonstrate galaxy colors in agreement with
stellar population synthesis models. Standard stellar photometry selection
techniques find approximately 1.3 million stars across the 6 galaxy fields.
Euclid's resolved stellar photometry allows us to constrain the star-formation
histories of these galaxies, by disentangling the distributions of young stars,
as well as asymptotic giant branch and red giant branch stellar populations. We
finally examine 2 galaxies individually for surrounding satellite systems. Our
analysis of the ensemble of dwarf satellites around NGC6744 reveals a new
galaxy, EDwC1, a nucleated dwarf spheroidal at the end of a spiral arm. Our new
census of the globular clusters around NGC2403 yields 9 new star-cluster
candidates, 8 of which with colors indicative of evolved stellar populations.
In summary, our investigation of the 6 Showcase galaxies demonstrates that
Euclid is a powerful probe of the anatomy of nearby galaxies [abridged].

tests to distinguish diseased and non-diseased subjects. The accuracy of such
diagnostic tests is commonly assessed using the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve. To summarize an ROC curve and determine its optimal
cut-point, the Youden index is popularly used. In literature, estimation of the
Youden index has been widely studied via various statistical modeling
strategies on the conditional density. This paper proposes a new model-free
estimation method, which directly estimates the covariate-adjusted cut-point
without estimating the conditional density. Consequently, covariate-adjusted
Youden index can be estimated based on the estimated cutpoint. The proposed
method formulates the estimation problem in a large margin classification
framework, which allows flexible modeling of the covariate-adjusted Youden
index through kernel machines. The advantage of the proposed method is
demonstrated in a variety of simulated experiments as well as a real

systems are determined self-consistently. Deriving equations of motion for the
basic variables, graphene Bloch equations are introduced and combined with a
variational Ansatz for the ground state. Within the Hartree--Fock
approximation, this approach reproduces the gap equation for the ground state.
The results show that the Coulomb interaction drastically influences the
optical response of graphene and introduces an extremely sensitive dependency
on the dielectric environment via screening. Regarding the effective
fine-structure constant as control parameter, a transition from a semimetal to
an excitonic insulator is predicted as soon as the effective graphene
fine-structure constant exceeds a value of roughly 0.5. Above this critical
value, the computed optical spectra exhibit a pseudogap and several bright
$p$-like excitonic resonances.

modes at domain walls between its two different stable chiral edge phases
without superconductivity. This is due to the existence of an edge phase that
does not support gapless fermionic excitations; all gapless excitations are
bosonic in this edge phase. Majorana fermion zero modes occur at a domain wall
between this edge phase and the more conventional one that does support gapless
fermions. Remarkably, due to the chirality of the system, the topological
degeneracy of these zero modes has exponential protection, as a function of the
relevant length scales, in spite of the presence of gapless excitations,
including gapless fermions. These results are compatible with charge
conservation, but do not require it. We discuss generalizations to other
integer and fractional quantum Hall states, and classify possible mechanisms
for appearance of Majorana zero modes at domain walls.

They release ultra-relativistic jets producing non-thermal emission through
synchrotron radiation as they interact with the surrounding medium (Zhang et
al. 2004). Here we report observations of the peculiar GRB 101225A (the
""Christmas burst""). Its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followed
by a bright X-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual optical
counterpart. During the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as an
expanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistent
with a faint supernova, emerged. We determine its distance to 1.6 Gpc by
fitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the optical
emission with a GRB-supernova template. Deep optical observations may have
revealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. Our proposed progenitor is a helium
star-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling its
hydrogen envelope. The resulting explosion created a GRB-like jet which gets
thermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thus
creating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernova
dominated. An alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutron
star in the Galaxy (Campana et al. 2011).

drift upon release, for a wide range of magnetic flux values, we identify an
emergent Hall plateau compatible with a fractional Chern insulator state: the
extracted Hall conductivity approaches a fractional value determined by the
many-body Chern number, while the width of the plateau agrees with the spectral
and topological properties of the prepared ground state. Besides, a direct
application of Streda's formula indicates that such Hall plateaus can also be
directly obtained from static density-profile measurements. Our calculations
suggest that fractional Chern insulators can be detected in cold-atom

roughly evenly distributed between them, while fixing the position in

z>6, during the epoch of reionization. Connecting these observed populations to
the process of reionization requires understanding how efficiently they produce
Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and what fraction (fesc) of these photons escape
into the intergalactic medium. By applying the Cox proportional hazards model,
a survival analysis technique, to the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey
(LzLCS), we develop new, empirical, multivariate predictions for fesc. The
models developed from the LzLCS reproduce the observed fesc for z~3 samples,
which suggests that LyC emitters may share similar properties at low and high
redshift. Our best-performing models for the z~3 galaxies include information
about dust attenuation, ionization, and/or morphology. We then apply these
models to z$\gtrsim$6 galaxies. For large photometric samples, we find a median
predicted fesc=0.047-0.14. For smaller spectroscopic samples, which may include
stronger emission line galaxies, we find that $\geq$33% of the galaxies have
fesc >0.2, and we identify several candidate extreme leakers with fesc
$\geq$0.5. The current samples show no strong trend between predicted fesc and
UV magnitude, but limited spectroscopic information makes this result
uncertain. Multivariate predictions can give significantly different results
from single variable predictions, and the predicted fesc for high-redshift
galaxies can differ significantly depending on whether star formation rate
surface density or radius is used as a measure of galaxy morphology. We provide
all parameters necessary to predict fesc for additional samples of
high-redshift galaxies using these models.

time are ubiquitous across various fields. Temporal Point Processes (TPPs)
provide a mathematical framework for modeling these sequences, enabling
inferences such as predicting the arrival time of future events and their
associated label, called mark. However, due to model misspecification or lack
of training data, these probabilistic models may provide a poor approximation
of the true, unknown underlying process, with prediction regions extracted from
them being unreliable estimates of the underlying uncertainty. This paper
develops more reliable methods for uncertainty quantification in neural TPP
models via the framework of conformal prediction. A primary objective is to
generate a distribution-free joint prediction region for an event's arrival
time and mark, with a finite-sample marginal coverage guarantee. A key
challenge is to handle both a strictly positive, continuous response and a
categorical response, without distributional assumptions. We first consider a
simple but conservative approach that combines individual prediction regions
for the event's arrival time and mark. Then, we introduce a more effective
method based on bivariate highest density regions derived from the joint
predictive density of arrival times and marks. By leveraging the dependencies
between these two variables, this method excludes unlikely combinations of the
two, resulting in sharper prediction regions while still attaining the
pre-specified coverage level. We also explore the generation of individual
univariate prediction regions for events' arrival times and marks through
conformal regression and classification techniques. Moreover, we evaluate the
stronger notion of conditional coverage. Finally, through extensive
experimentation on both simulated and real-world datasets, we assess the
validity and efficiency of these methods.

eigenvalues of the electronic Hamiltonian -- an unbounded, self-adjoint
operator acting on a Hilbert space of antisymmetric functions. Coupled cluster
(CC) methods, which are based on a non-linear parameterisation of the
sought-after eigenfunction and result in non-linear systems of equations, are
the method of choice for high accuracy quantum chemical simulations but their
numerical analysis is underdeveloped. The existing numerical analysis relies on
a local, strong monotonicity property of the CC function that is valid only in
a perturbative regime, i.e., when the sought-after ground state CC solution is
sufficiently close to zero. In this article, we introduce a new well-posedness
analysis for the single reference coupled cluster method based on the
invertibility of the CC derivative. Under the minimal assumption that the
sought-after eigenfunction is intermediately normalisable and the associated
eigenvalue is isolated and non-degenerate, we prove that the continuous
(infinite-dimensional) CC equations are always locally well-posed. Under the
same minimal assumptions and provided that the discretisation is fine enough,
we prove that the discrete Full-CC equations are locally well-posed, and we
derive residual-based error estimates with guaranteed positive constants.
Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the constants that appear in
our estimates are a significant improvement over those obtained from the local
monotonicity approach.

were photographed by multiple people using 23 different mobile devices. The
resulting 19 728 photographs of various visual quality are accompanied by
precise positions and text annotations of 500k text lines. We further provide
an evaluation methodology, including an evaluation server and a testset with
non-public annotations.

on easy, medium and hard parts of the dataset, respectively, confirming that
the dataset is challenging.

methodology to the Planck CMB data and explore the functional space of
single-field inflationary potentials in a non-parametric, yet analytical way.
We show that the algorithm easily improves upon the vanilla model of quadratic
inflation and proposes slow-roll potentials better suited to the data, while we
confirm the robustness of the Starobinsky inflation model (and other
small-field models). Moreover, using unbinned CMB data, we perform a first
concrete application of the GA by searching for oscillatory features in the
potential in an agnostic way, and find very significant improvements upon the
best featureless potentials, $\Delta \chi^2 < -20$. These encouraging
preliminary results motivate the search for resonant features in the primordial
power spectrum with a multimodal distribution of frequencies. We stress that
our pipeline is modular and can easily be extended to other CMB data sets and
inflationary scenarios, like multifield inflation or theories with higher-order
derivatives.

systematically evaluate VLMs for open-set recognition and find they frequently
misclassify objects not contained in their query set, leading to alarmingly low

increasing the size of the query set to contain more and more classes does not
mitigate this problem, but instead causes diminishing task performance and
open-set performance. We establish a revised definition of the open-set problem

Despite the success of preference learning in personalized news recommendation,
their over-exploitation causes filter bubble that isolates readers from
opposing viewpoints and hurts long-term user experiences with lack of
serendipity. Since news providers can recommend neither opposite nor
diversified opinions if unpopularity of these articles is surely predicted,
they can only bet on the articles whose forecasts of click-through rate involve
high variability (risks) or high estimation errors (uncertainties). We propose
a novel Bayesian model of uncertainty-aware scoring and ranking for news

as a news click) as a Beta-distributed random variable conditional on a vector
of the context (user features, article features, and other contextual
features). The posterior of the contextual coefficients can be computed
efficiently using a low-rank version of Laplace's method via thin Singular

articles, which are chosen by each subscriber in test period, are evaluated on
real-world news datasets. The proposed estimator slightly outperformed existing

customer retention, to target those customers who are more likely to respond
due to the campaign or treatment. Essentially, it is a machine learning
technique that predicts the gain from performing some action with respect to
not taking it. A popular class of uplift models is the transformation approach
that redefines the target variable with the original treatment indicator. These
transformation approaches only need to train and predict the difference in
outcomes directly. The main drawback of these approaches is that in general it
does not use the information in the treatment indicator beyond the construction
of the transformed outcome and usually is not efficient. In this paper, we
design a novel transformed outcome for the case of the binary target variable
and unlock the full value of the samples with zero outcome. From a practical
perspective, our new approach is flexible and easy to use. Experimental results
on synthetic and real-world datasets obviously show that our new approach
outperforms the traditional one. At present, our new approach has already been

We do this by means of a small simulation study with simple point process
models and estimating the two-point correlation functions and their errors. The
coverage of confidence intervals obtained using bootstrap is compared with
those obtained from assuming Poisson errors. The bootstrap procedure considered
here is adapted for use with spatial (i.e. dependent) data. In particular, we
describe a marked point bootstrap where, instead of resampling points or blocks
of points, we resample marks assigned to the data points. These marks are
numerical values that are based on the statistic of interest. We describe how
the marks are defined for the two- and three-point correlation functions. By
resampling marks, the bootstrap samples retain more of the dependence structure
present in the data. Furthermore, this method of bootstrap can be performed
much quicker than some other bootstrap methods for spatial data, making it a
more practical method with large datasets. We find that with clustered point
datasets, confidence intervals obtained using the marked point bootstrap has
empirical coverage closer to the nominal level than the confidence intervals
obtained using Poisson errors. The bootstrap errors were also found to be
closer to the true errors for the clustered point datasets.

biotechnology industries, improving energy efficiency, color purity, and
imaging capability. However, the standard quantum dot relies on a heavy metal
architecture, which has undesirable environmental impacts. Thus, alternative
material systems are desirable. One strategy is the ZnS-AgInS2 (ZAIS) quantum
dot which has a metal dichalcogenide chemical structure. Unlike heavy metal
quantum dots, these nanoparticles luminesce even when defects are present, and
their emission wavelength is tuned by varying the relative composition. Past
works have linked the source of this luminescence to a defect-assisted
transition recombination process, but the precise mechanism is still unclear.
In this work, we investigate the physics of this defect-assisted transition by
systematically varying the concentration of defects through a simple quick-cool
thermal annealing process which provides control over the crystalline disorder
of the nanoparticle. Using a combination of ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements, information about the nature of the
defect-assisted transition is obtained. In contrast to previous work, we find
that the ZAIS quantum dot luminescence has an electronic-based rather than
defect-assisted transition mechanism.

have correspondingly very robust magnetic dynamos and strong coronal and
chromospheric X-ray - UV (XUV) emissions. However, these stars spin-down with
time as they lose angular momentum via magnetized winds and their magnetic
generated activity and emissions significantly decrease. Studies of dK-dM stars

targets for further study because of their deep outer convective zones (CZs),
efficient dynamos, frequent flares and strong XUV emissions. Furthermore, a
large fraction of dM stars are very old (>5 Gyr), which present intriguing
possibilities for the development of highly advanced modes of intelligent life
on planets that may orbit them.

of these parameters have been studied empirically, until now there has not been
a unified comparative study of their explanatory power on a comprehensive
benchmark. We correct this state of affairs by conducting a large-scale
empirical evaluation of CDCL SAT solver performance on nearly 7000 industrial
and crafted formulas against several structural parameters such as backdoors,
treewidth, backbones, and community structure.
  Our study led us to several results. First, we show that while such

of them yield much better regression models. Second, we show how some
parameters can be used as a ""lens"" to better understand the efficiency of
different solving heuristics. Finally, we propose a new complexity-theoretic
parameter, which we call learning-sensitive with restarts (LSR) backdoors, that
extends the notion of learning-sensitive (LS) backdoors to incorporate restarts

attributed network embedding (ANE) maps each node v in G to a compact vector
Xv, which can be used in downstream machine learning tasks. Ideally, Xv should
capture node v's affinity to each attribute, which considers not only v's own
attribute associations, but also those of its connected nodes along edges in G.
It is challenging to obtain high-utility embeddings that enable accurate
predictions; scaling effective ANE computation to massive graphs pushes the
difficulty of the problem to a whole new level. Existing solutions largely fail
on such graphs, leading to prohibitive costs, low-quality embeddings, or both.
This paper proposes PANE, an effective and scalable approach to ANE computation
for massive graphs that achieves state-of-the-art result quality on multiple
benchmark datasets. PANE obtains high scalability and effectiveness through 3
main algorithmic designs. First, it formulates the learning objective based on
a novel random walk model for attributed networks. Second, PANE includes a
highly efficient solver for the above optimization problem, whose key module is
a carefully designed initialization of the embeddings, which drastically
reduces the number of iterations required to converge. Finally, PANE utilizes
multi-core CPUs through non-trivial parallelization of the above solver, which
achieves scalability while retaining the high quality of the resulting
embeddings. The performance of PANE depends upon the number of attributes in
the input network. To handle large networks with numerous attributes, we
further extend PANE to PANE++. Extensive experiments, comparing 10 existing
approaches on 8 real datasets, demonstrate that PANE and PANE++ consistently
outperform all existing methods in terms of result quality, while being orders
of magnitude faster.

background reconstruction; however, we innovatively utilize artificial
synthetic defects to enable the model to recognize anomalies, while traditional
wisdom relies only on defect-free samples. First, we employ an encoding module
to obtain multiscale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a
contrastive-learning-based memory feature module (CMFM) is proposed to obtain
discriminative representations and construct a normal feature memory bank in
the latent space, which can be employed as a substitute for defects and fast
anomaly scores at the patch level. Next, a novel global feature rearrangement
module (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual
defects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to
reconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection
performance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect
restoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to
achieve noise-robust defect localization. We verify our method through
extensive experiments and test its practical deployment in collaborative

cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

from the convolution of these equations with the interpolating kernel. The two
most important aspects of the numerical implementation of these equations are
(a) the appearance of fluid velocity and pressure obtained from the solution of
the Riemann problem between each pair of particles, and (b the absence of an
artificial viscosity term. We carry out three different controlled
hydrodynamical three-dimensional tests, namely the Sod shock tube, the
development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in a shear flow test, and the
""blob"" test describing the evolution of a cold cloud moving against a hot wind.
  The results of our tests confirm and extend in a number of aspects those
recently obtained by Cha (2010): (i) GSPH provides a much improved description
of contact discontinuities, with respect to SPH, thus avoiding the appearance
of spurious pressure forces; (ii) GSPH is able to follow the development of
gas-dynamical instabilities, such as the Kevin--Helmholtz and the
Rayleigh-Taylor ones; (iii) as a result, GSPH describes the development of curl
structures in the shear-flow test and the dissolution of the cold cloud in the
""blob"" test.
  We also discuss in detail the effect on the performances of GSPH of changing
different aspects of its implementation. The results of our tests demonstrate
that GSPH is in fact a highly promising hydrodynamic scheme, also to be coupled
to an N-body solver, for astrophysical and cosmological applications.

The
observed angular distribution is isotropic, while the brightness distribution
of bursts shows a reduced number of faint events. These observations favor a
cosmological burst origin. Alternatively, very extended Galactic Halo (EGH)
models have been considered. In the latter scenario, the currently favored
source of gamma-ray bursts involves high velocity pulsars ejected from the
Galactic disk. To be compatible with the observed isotropy, most models invoke
a sampling distance of 300 kpc, a turn-on delay of 30 Myrs, and a source life
time of about 1 Gyr. We consider the global energy requirements of such models
and show that the largest known resource. rotational kinetic energy, is
insufficient by orders of magnitude to provide the observed burst rate. More
exotic energy sources or differently tuned pulsar models may be able to get
around the global energy constraint but at the cost of becoming contrived.
Thus, while extended halo models are not ruled out, our arguments place a
severe obstacle for such models and we encourage proponents of EGH models to
clearly address the issue of global energetics.

be random or generated from popular distributions. These initial embeddings
require multiple layers of transformation to converge into a meaningful latent
representation. While number of layers allow accumulation of larger
neighbourhood of a node it also introduce the problem of over-smoothing. In
addition, GNNs are inept at representing structural information. For example,
the output embedding of a node does not capture its triangles participation. In
this paper, we presented a novel feature extraction methodology GraphViz2Vec
that can capture the structural information of a node's local neighbourhood to
create meaningful initial embeddings for a GNN model. These initial embeddings
helps existing models achieve state-of-the-art results in various

produce desired results with only two layers which in turn reduce the problem
of over-smoothing. The initial encoding of a node is obtained from an image
classification model trained on multiple energy diagrams of its local
neighbourhood. These energy diagrams are generated with the induced sub-graph
of the nodes traversed by multiple random walks. The generated encodings

parameter correlation length. Here, we propose a paradigmatic shift, focusing
on a divergent characteristic time scale due to a divergent dissipation acting
on the fluctuating critical modes, while their correlation length stays finite.

close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (CEGPs) that has the virtues of
simplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. Given a series of
stellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goal
is to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative to
the component coming directly from the star. We use two complementary
strategies, both of which rely on the predictable Doppler shifts of both
components and on combining the results from many spectral lines and many
exposures. In the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrum
that are free of direct absorption lines and add them after Doppler-shifting
into the planetary frame. In the second strategy, we compare the distribution
of equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. Both
strategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled Doppler
shifts are applied to the spectral segments. As an illustrative test case, we
apply our technique to spectra of HD 209458 taken when the planet was near
opposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where
0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is
$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. This
corresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase function
of a Lambert sphere. Although the result is not statistically significant, the
achieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is based
are very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scattered

function of the protostars in a region of star formation. It is determined
using the protostellar mass function (PMF) in combination with a stellar
evolutionary model that provides the luminosity as a function of instantaneous
and final stellar mass. As in McKee & Offner (2010), we consider three main
accretion models: the Isothermal Sphere model, the Turbulent Core model, and an
approximation of the Competitive Accretion model. We also consider the effect
of an accretion rate that tapers off linearly in time and an accelerating star
formation rate. For each model, we characterize the luminosity distribution
using the mean, median, maximum, ratio of the median to the mean, standard
deviation of the logarithm of the luminosity, and the fraction of very low
luminosity objects. We compare the models with bolometric luminosities observed
in local star forming regions and find that models with an approximately
constant accretion time, such as the Turbulent Core and Competitive Accretion
models, appear to agree better with observation than those with a constant
accretion rate, such as the Isothermal Sphere model. We show that observations
of the mean protostellar luminosity in these nearby regions of low-mass star
formation suggest a mean star formation time of 0.3$\pm$0.1 Myr. Such a
timescale, together with some accretion that occurs non-radiatively and some
that occurs in high-accretion, episodic bursts, resolves the classical
""luminosity problem"" in low-mass star formation, in which observed protostellar
luminosities are significantly less than predicted. An accelerating star
formation rate is one possible way of reconciling the observed star formation
time and mean luminosity.

Given two systems, each with a global symmetry, gauging the composite symmetry
instead of individual symmetries corresponds to the condensation of the
composite of gauge charges belonging to individually gauged theories and the
binding of the gauge fluxes. The condensed composite charge is created by a
""short"" string given by the new minimal coupling corresponding to the composite
symmetry. This paper studies what happens when combined subsystem symmetries
are gauged, especially when the component charges and fluxes have different
sub-dimensional mobilities. We investigate $3+1$D systems with planar
symmetries where, for example, the planar symmetry of a planon charge is
combined with one of the planar symmetries of a fracton charge. We propose the
principle of $\textit{Remote Detectability}$ to determine how the fluxes bind
and potentially change their mobility. This understanding can then be used to
design fracton models with sub-dimensional excitations that are decorated with
excitations having nontrivial statistics or non-abelian fusion rules.

structure uncertainty in predicting WFN arising from multi-input models,
including nine ground impedance and four wind speed profile models. We used a
numerical ray tracing sound propagation model for predicting the noise level at

uncertainty, and that these sources contributed to predicted noise level
differences in excess of 10 dBA at distances greater than 3.5 km. We also found
that differences between atmospheric vertical wind speed profile models were
the main source of uncertainty in predicting WFN at long-range distances. When
predicting WFN, it is important to acknowledge variability associated with
different models as this contributes to the uncertainty of the predicted
values.

of a major merger that occurred > 1.5 Gyr ago. From modelling optical long-slit

past starburst event, dominates the stellar light throughout the galaxy. The
off-set in time between the merger event and the starburst activity in B2

merger, which can be explained if the gas-rich progenitor galaxies contained a
bulge. Although the exact age of the radio source remains uncertain, there

as toy models to probe universal properties of conformal field theory (CFT)
using the gauge/gravity duality. In this context, we are particularly
interested in generalized quasi-topological gravities, i.e., theories whose
equations of motion for statically spherically symmetric solutions are of
second order at most. Here, we characterize the number of these theories
existing at a given curvature order and dimensions. Moreover, we show that any
effective higher-curvature theory is connected, via field redefinitions to some
generalized quasi-topological gravity. The situation is special for three
spacetime dimensions, as theories of this type have trivial equations of
motion. However, when matter fields are added into the picture, the equations
of motion become non-trivial, describing, among other solutions,
multiparametric generalizations of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole.
  From the CFT side, entanglement entropy arises as a prominent quantity that
encodes important information about the field theory, such as the type A and
type B trace anomalies in even dimensions and the sphere free energy of the
theory in odd dimensions when considering spherical entangling regions. As
entanglement entropy also includes divergences, we employ the Kounterterms
scheme to extract the physically relevant quantities. In the case of
three-dimensional CFTs dual to Einstein gravity, we show that the finite part
is isolated and can be written in terms of the Willmore energy, providing an
upper bound based on its properties. We extend this remarkable result to
arbitrary CFTs under consideration. Besides, we show the validity of the
Kounterterms scheme for general quadratic curvature gravity, extracting the
type A, type B anomalies of the theory in even dimensions and the sphere free
energy in odd ones.

of twisted vector bundles (of finite or infinite dimension) and of twisted
principal bundles. This is closeely related to the classical notion ot torsors
and bundles of modules over an algebra bundle.
  Twisted K-theory is simply defined as the Grothendieck group of twisted
vector bundles (with a given twist). The usual operations on vector bundles
(exterior powers, Adams operations) are easily extended to this twisted
framework. Graded twisted K-theory, which is important for the definition and
proof of the Thom isomorphism in this framework, is defined with the same
formalism.
  We also define a twisted Chern character with target ""twisted cohomology"".
Although there are many definitions of this character in the literature, our
method is more elementary and is based on the classical definitions of the
Chern-Weil theory, via connections and curvatures. In this way, we get explicit
formulas very much in the spirit of Steenrod's coordinate bundles.

more effective technique for representing textual requirements to infer effort
estimates by analogy, this paper proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of
pre-trained embeddings models. For this, two embeddings approach, context-less
and contextualized models are used. Generic pre-trained models for both
approaches went through a fine-tuning process. The generated models were used
as input in the applied deep learning architecture, with linear output. The
results were very promising, realizing that pre-trained incorporation models
can be used to estimate software effort based only on requirements texts. We
highlight the results obtained to apply the pre-trained BERT model with
fine-tuning in a single project repository, whose value is the Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) is 4.25 and the standard deviation of only 0.17, which represents a
result very positive when compared to similar works. The main advantages of the

controllable editing performance, unlike prior work, which primarily focuses on

the maneuver, like the forces generated by the spacecraft-atmosphere

for multiple passages around secondary bodies. However, these applications
require improvements in critical subsystems, which are necessary to accomplish

the advantages and limitations of these variations. There are analyzed the
effects of implementing low Lift-to-Drag ratios at high altitudes for
Aero-gravity Assist maneuvers, with and without propulsion. The maneuvers were

detailed structures of the dense envelope within the core. We found that the
core has a radial density profile of n(r) prop. r^-p and a reliable difference
in the power-law indices between the outer and inner regions of the core: p~2
for r >= 4000 AU and p ~ 1.5 for r <= 4000 AU}. The dense core shows a slight
overall velocity gradient of ~1.0 km s^-1 over the scale of 20,000 AU across
the outflow axis. We believe that this velocity gradient represents a
solid-body-like rotation of the core. The dense envelope has a quite
symmetrical velocity structure with a remarkable line broadening toward the
core center, which is especially prominent in the position-velocity diagram
across the outflow axis. The model calculations of position-velocity diagrams
do a good job of reproducing observational results using the collapse model of
an isothermal sphere in which the core has an inner free-fall region and an
outer region conserving the conditions at the formation stage of a central
stellar object. We derived a central stellar mass of ~0.1 M_sun, and suggest a
small inward velocity, v(r>r_inf) ~ 0 km s^-1 in the outer core at >= 4000 AU.

a quasi-static initial condition, such as Shu's model, or by the isothermal

proportion of the global burden of diseases. Automated diagnosis systems of
such disorders, empowered by recent innovations in Artificial Intelligence, can
pave the way to reduce the sufferings of the affected individuals. Development
of such systems requires information-rich and balanced corpora. In this work,
we introduce a novel mental distress analysis audio dataset DEPAC, labeled
based on established thresholds on depression and anxiety standard screening
tools. This large dataset comprises multiple speech tasks per individual, as
well as relevant demographic information. Alongside, we present a feature set
consisting of hand-curated acoustic and linguistic features, which were found
effective in identifying signs of mental illnesses in human speech. Finally, we
justify the quality and effectiveness of our proposed audio corpus and feature
set in predicting depression severity by comparing the performance of baseline
machine learning models built on this dataset with baseline models trained on
other well-known depression corpora.

to high reduced-temperatures and magnetic fields. This method allows us to
carry out a criterion-independent determination of the angular dependence of

significant deviation from the single-band 3D anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau

judge the stellar evolution theory. With the old solar composition (e.g.,
GS98), the solar standard model is in reasonable agreement with the
helioseismic constraints. However, a solar model with revised composition
(e.g., AGSS09) with low abundance $Z$ of heavy elements cannot be consistent
with those constraints. This is the so-called ""solar abundance problem"",

field exerted by this tiny but very massive object, both neutral and charged,
is carried out. By using this method, a very rare exact result of the
particle's quantized energy can be discovered. The presence of a very strong
attractive field and also the horizon make the energy complex valued and force
the corresponding wave function to be a quasibound state. Moreover, by taking
the small scale limit, the system becomes a gravitational atom in the sense of
Hydrogenic atoms energy levels and its wave function can be rediscovered.
Moreover, analogous to electronic transitions, the transition of the particle
in this case emits a graviton which carries a unique fingerprint of the black
hole such as black hole's mass and charge.

fermion compound URu2Si2 realized in order to clarify the nature of the hidden
order (HO) phase which occurs below T_0 = 17.5 K at ambient pressure. The
choice was to measure at a given pressure P where the system will go, by
lowering the temperature, successively from paramagnetic (PM) to HO and then to
antiferromagnetic phase (AF). Furthermore, in order to verify the selection of
the pressure, a macroscopic detection of the phase transitions was also
achieved in situ via its thermal expansion response detected by a strain gauge
glued on the crystal. Just above P_x = 0.5 GPa, where the ground state switches
from HO to AF, the Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) excitation disappears while the excitation
at the incommensurate wavevector Q_1 = (1.4, 0, 0) remains. Thus, the Q_0 = (1,
0, 0) excitation is intrinsic only in the HO phase. This result is reinforced
by studies where now pressure and magnetic field $H$ can be used as tuning
variable. Above P_x, the AF phase at low temperature is destroyed by a magnetic
field larger than H_AF (collapse of the AF Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) Bragg reflection).
The field reentrance of the HO phase is demonstrated by the reappearance of its
characteristic Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) excitation. The recovery of a PM phase will only
be achieved far above H_AF at H_M approx 35 T. To determine the P-H-T phase
diagram of URu2Si2, macroscopic measurements of the thermal expansion were
realized with a strain gauge. The reentrant magnetic field increases strongly
with pressure. Finally, to investigate the interplay between superconductivity
(SC) and spin dynamics, new inelastic neutron scattering experiments are
reported down to 0.4 K, far below the superconducting critical temperature T_SC
approx 1.3 K as measured on our crystal by diamagnetic shielding.

between the amplitude of density fluctuations extrapolated from the cosmic
microwave background within the standard cosmological model and the one
encapsulated by the $S_8$ parameter from large scale structure. The origin of
this $S_8$ tension has not yet been elucidated and may hint at systematics in
the data, unaccounted effects from baryonic physics, or new physics beyond the
standard model of cosmology. Baryonic physics may in principle provide a
nonlinear solution to the tension by suppressing the matter power spectrum more
strongly on nonlinear scales than is traditionally assumed. Such a solution
would not worsen the Hubble tension, contrary to many other proposed solutions
to the $S_8$ tension. However, no realistic baryonic feedback in hydrodynamical
simulations provides the needed suppression as a function of redshift. Here, we
point out that a scale-dependence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianities
(PNG), with significant PNG at scales of a few Mpc, can provide the needed
suppression, since such PNG can suppress the power spectrum at slightly larger
scales than baryons do. We demonstrate this by devising collisionless numerical
simulations of structure formation in boxes of 0.5 Gpc/$h$ with scale-dependent
local-type PNG. Our simple models show that, as a proof of principle,
scale-dependent PNG, with a Gaussian random field for primordial density
fluctuations on large scales and $f_{\rm NL} \simeq -300$ at $\lesssim 10$ Mpc
scales, together with state-of-the-art baryonification of the matter power
spectrum, can in principle solve the $S_8$ tension. The $S_8$ tension would
then be a smoking-gun of non-trivial inflationary physics.

gravitational waves possess two polarizations, each traveling at the velocity

partitioning the input uncertainty set and solving the relaxations on each part
separately. We show that this approach reduces relaxation error, and that the
error is eliminated entirely upon performing an LP relaxation with a partition
intelligently designed to exploit the nature of the ReLU activations. To scale
this approach to large networks, we consider using a coarser partition whereby
the number of parts in the partition is reduced. We prove that computing such a
coarse partition that directly minimizes the LP relaxation error is NP-hard. By
instead minimizing the worst-case LP relaxation error, we develop a closed-form
branching scheme. We extend the analysis to the SDP, where the feasible set
geometry is exploited to design a branching scheme that minimizes the
worst-case SDP relaxation error. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Wisconsin
breast cancer diagnosis classifiers demonstrate significant increases in the
percentages of test samples certified. By independently increasing the input

blow-up arising when reasoning about several feature combinations. However,
most formal verification approaches for SPLs presented in the literature focus
on the static SPLs, where the features of a product are fixed and cannot be
changed during runtime. This is in contrast to dynamic SPLs, allowing to adapt
feature combinations of a product dynamically after deployment. The main
contribution of the paper is a compositional modeling framework for dynamic
SPLs, which supports probabilistic and nondeterministic choices and allows for
quantitative analysis. We specify the feature changes during runtime within an
automata-based coordination component, enabling to reason over strategies how
to trigger dynamic feature changes for optimizing various quantitative
objectives, e.g., energy or monetary costs and reliability. For our framework
there is a natural and conceptually simple translation into the input language
of the prominent probabilistic model checker PRISM. This facilitates the

polynomial in the length of the shortest division-free Straight Line Program
(SLP) that computes $n$.
  If the answer to this question is ""yes"", then we can show a stronger upper
bound for $\mathrm{PosSLP}$, the important problem which essentially captures
the notion of efficient computation over the reals. If the answer is ""no"", then
this would demonstrate how subtraction helps generating integers
super-polynomially faster, given that addition and multiplication can be done
in unit time.
  In this paper, we show that, for almost all numbers, AMCs and SLPs need same
asymptotic length for computation. However, for one specific form of numbers,
SLPs are strictly more powerful than AMCs by at least one step of computation.

improve Jerrum's bound using the grundy number, which is the worst number of

between them. In both cases, the bounds cannot be improved by more than a
constant factor for a fixed $\chi(G)$. The graph classes are also optimal in
some sense: one of the smallest interesting superclass of distance-hereditary

of interacting particle assemblies driven by externally imposed stresses or
deformation is of interest in comprehending diverse phenomena in soft matter.
They have been investigated in a wide range of systems, such as colloidal
suspensions, glasses, and granular matter. In different density and driving
regimes, such behaviour is related to yielding of amorphous solids, jamming,
and memory formation, \emph{etc.} How these phenomena are related to each other
has not, however, been much studied. In order to obtain a unified view of the
different regimes of behaviour, and transitions between them, we investigate
computationally the response of soft sphere assemblies to athermal cyclic shear
deformation over a wide range of densities and amplitudes of shear deformation.
Cyclic shear deformation induces transitions from reversible to irreversible
behaviour in both unjammed and jammed soft sphere packings. Well above
isotropic jamming density ($\bf{\phi_J}$), this transition corresponds to
yielding. In the vicinity of the jamming point, up to a higher density limit we
designate ${\bf \phi_J^{cyc}}$, an unjammed phase emerges between a localised,
\emph{absorbing} phase, and a diffusive, {\emph irreversible} phase. The
emergence of the unjammed phase signals the shifting of the jamming point to
higher densities as a result of annealing, and opens a window where shear
jamming becomes possible for frictionless packings. Below $\bf{\phi_J}$, two
distinct localised states, termed point and loop reversibile, are observed. We
characterise in detail the different regimes and transitions between them, and
obtain a unified density-shear amplitude phase diagram.

exciting prospect as a wavelength measurement method due to its high resolution
and simple design. In previous studies, panel cameras have been used to detect
the subtle differences between speckle patterns. However, the volume,
bandwidth, sensitivity, and cost (in non-visible bands) associated with panel
cameras have hindered their utility in broader applications, especially in high
speed and low-cost measurements. In this work, we broke the limitations imposed
by panel cameras by using a quadrant detector (QD) to capture the speckle
images. In the scheme of QD detection, speckle images are directly filtered by
convolution, where the kernel is equal to one quarter of a speckle pattern.
First, we proposed an up-sampling algorithm to pre-process the QD data. Then a
new convolution neural network (CNN) based algorithm, shallow residual network
(SRN), was proposed to train the up-sampled images. The experimental results
show that a resolution of 4 fm (~ 0.5 MHz) was achieved at 1550nm with an
updating speed of ~ 1 kHz. More importantly, the SRN shows excellent
robustness. The wavelength can be precisely reconstructed from raw QD data
without any averaging, even where there exists apparent noise. The low-cost,
simple structure, high speed and robustness of this design promote the
speckle-based wavemeter to the industrial grade. In addition, without the
restriction of panel cameras, it is believed that this wavemeter opens new
routes in many other fields, such as distributed optical fiber sensors, optical
communications, and laser frequency stabilization.

has become increasingly important for numerous applications in both cloud
computing (e.g., Apple's Siri) and edge computing (e.g., Google/Waymo's
driverless car). FPGA-based DNN accelerators have demonstrated both superior
flexibility and performance; in addition, for real-time inference with low
batch size, FPGA is expected to achieve further performance improvement.
However, the performance gain from the single-FPGA design is obstructed by the
limited on-chip resource. In this paper, we employ multiple FPGAs to
cooperatively run DNNs with the objective of achieving super-linear speed-up
against single-FPGA design. In implementing such systems, we found two barriers
that hinder us from achieving the design goal: (1) the lack of a clear
partition scheme for each DNN layer to fully exploit parallelism, and (2) the
insufficient bandwidth between the off-chip memory and the accelerator due to
the growing size of DNNs. To tackle these issues, we propose a general
framework, ""Super-LIP"", which can support different kinds of DNNs. In this
paper, we take Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a vehicle to illustrate
Super-LIP. We first formulate an accurate system-level model to support the
exploration of best partition schemes. Then, we develop a novel design
methodology to effectively alleviate the heavy loads on memory bandwidth by
moving traffic from memory bus to inter-FPGA links. We implement Super-LIP
based on ZCU102 FPGA boards. Results demonstrate that Super-LIP with 2 FPGAs
can achieve 3.48x speedup, compared to the state-of-the-art single-FPGA design.
What is more, as the number of FPGAs scales up, the system latency can be
further reduced while maintaining high energy efficiency.

in biomedical applications ranging from tumor tracking for targeted radiation
therapy to classifying cells in a blood sample. Our focus is on hierarchical
probability models for the shape and size of simply connected 2D closed curves,
avoiding the need to specify landmarks through modeling the entire curve while
borrowing information across curves for related objects. Prevalent approaches
follow a fundamentally different strategy in providing an initial point
estimate of the curve and/or locations of landmarks, which are then fed into
subsequent statistical analyses. Such two-stage methods ignore uncertainty in
the first stage, and do not allow borrowing of information across objects in
estimating object shapes and sizes. Our fully Bayesian hierarchical model is
based on multiscale deformations within a linear combination of cyclic basis
characterization, which facilitates automatic alignment of the different curves
accounting for uncertainty. The characterization is shown to be highly flexible
in representing 2D closed curves, leading to a nonparametric Bayesian prior
with large support. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are developed
for simultaneous analysis of many objects. The methods are evaluated through
simulation examples and applied to yeast cell imaging data.

toolbox. The goal is to enable intuitive deformations of single or multiple
shapes or to transfer example deformations to new shapes while preserving the
plausibility of the deformed shape(s). Existing approaches assume access to
point-level or part-level correspondence or establish them in a preprocessing
phase, thus limiting the scope and generality of such approaches. We propose
DeformSyncNet, a new approach that allows consistent and synchronized shape
deformations without requiring explicit correspondence information.
Technically, we achieve this by encoding deformations into a class-specific
idealized latent space while decoding them into an individual, model-specific
linear deformation action space, operating directly in 3D. The underlying
encoding and decoding are performed by specialized (jointly trained) neural
networks. By design, the inductive bias of our networks results in a
deformation space with several desirable properties, such as path invariance
across different deformation pathways, which are then also approximately
preserved in real space. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our
framework against multiple alternative approaches and demonstrate improved
performance.

be best explained within the frame of the core-degenerate (CD) scenario. In the
CD scenario a white dwarf (WD) merges with the core of an asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star and forms a rapidly rotating WD, with a mass close to and
above the critical mass for explosion. Rapid rotation prevents immediate
collapse and/or explosion. Spinning down over a time of 0-10 Gyr brings the WD
to explosion. A very long delayed explosion to post-crystallization phase,
which lasts for about 2 Gyr leads to the formation of a highly carbon-enriched
outer layer. This can account for the carbon-rich composition of the
fastest-moving ejecta of SN 2011fe. In reaching the conclusion that the CD
scenario best explains the observed properties of SN 2011fe we consider both
its specific properties, like a very compact exploding object and carbon rich
composition of the fastest-moving ejecta, and the general properties of SNe Ia.

tensor of a stellar population are generally unequal and are oriented
perpendicular to a set of orthogonal surfaces at each point, then those
surfaces must be confocal quadric surfaces and the potential must be separable
or Stackel. This is true under the mild assumption that the even part of the
distribution function is invariant under time reversal $v_i \rightarrow -v_i$
of each velocity component. In particular, if the second velocity moment tensor
is everywhere exactly aligned in spherical polar coordinates, then the
potential must be of Stackel form (excepting degenerate cases where two or more
of the semiaxes of ellipsoid are everywhere the same). The theorem also has
consequences for alignment in cylindrical polar coordinates, which is used in
the popular Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). We analyse data on the radial
velocities and proper motions of a sample of $\sim 7400$ stars in the stellar
halo of the Milky Way. We provide the distributions of the tilt angles or
misalignments from the spherical polar coordinate systems. We show that in this
sample the misalignment is always small (usually within $3^\circ$) for radii
between 7 and 12 kpc. The velocity anisotropy is very radially biased ($\beta
\approx 0.7$), and almost invariant across the volume in our study. Finally, we
construct a triaxial stellar halo in a triaxial NFW dark matter halo using a
made-to-measure method. Despite the triaxiality of the potential, the velocity
ellipsoid of the stellar halo is nearly spherically aligned within
$\sim6^\circ$ for large regions of space, particularly outside the scale radius
of the stellar halo. We conclude that the second velocity moment ellipsoid can
be close to spherically aligned for a much wider class of potentials than the
strong constraints that arise from exact alignment might suggest.

research from the field of robotic grasping to propose two new six-dimensional
bounded polytopes named the Actuation Wrench Polytope (AWP) and the Feasible
Wrench Polytope (FWP). We define the AWP as the set of all the wrenches that a
robot can generate while considering its actuation limits. This considers the
admissible contact forces that the robot can generate given its current
configuration and actuation capabilities. The Contact Wrench Cone (CWC),
instead, includes features of the environment such as the contact normal or the
friction coefficient. The intersection of the AWP and of the CWC results in a
convex polytope, the FWP, which turns out to be more descriptive of the real
robot capabilities than existing simplified models, while maintaining the same
compact representation. We explain how to efficiently compute the
vertex-description of the FWP that is then used to evaluate a feasibility
factor that we adapted from the field of robotic grasping. This allows us to
optimize for robustness to external disturbance wrenches. Based on this, we
present an implementation of a motion planner for our quadruped robot HyQ that
provides online Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories that are guaranteed to be

is a rescaling of the Tracy-Widom distribution. Based on this result, we
suggest algorithms for the model rank selection and compare them with the
algorithm suggested by Bunea, She and Wegkamp. Next, we design two consistent
estimators for the singular values of the coefficient matrix, compare them, and
derive the asymptotic distribution for one of these estimators..

of hateful online content, including implicit hate speech, poses significant
challenges to human moderators and content moderation systems. To address this
issue, we developed ToxVis, a visually interactive and explainable tool for
classifying hate speech into three categories: implicit, explicit, and
non-hateful. We fine-tuned two transformer-based models using RoBERTa, XLNET,

explanations for the classification results. ToxVis enables users to input
potentially hateful text and receive a classification result along with a
visual explanation of which words contributed most to the decision. By making
the classification process explainable, ToxVis provides a valuable tool for
understanding the nuances of hateful content and supporting more effective
content moderation. Our research contributes to the growing body of work aimed
at mitigating the harms caused by online hate speech and demonstrates the
potential for combining state-of-the-art natural language processing models

focus on feature imitation instead of mimicking the prediction logits due to
its inefficiency in distilling the localization information. In this paper, we
investigate whether logit mimicking always lags behind feature imitation.
Towards this goal, we first present a novel localization distillation (LD)
method which can efficiently transfer the localization knowledge from the
teacher to the student. Second, we introduce the concept of valuable
localization region that can aid to selectively distill the classification and
localization knowledge for a certain region. Combining these two new
components, for the first time, we show that logit mimicking can outperform
feature imitation and the absence of localization distillation is a critical
reason for why logit mimicking underperforms for years. The thorough studies
exhibit the great potential of logit mimicking that can significantly alleviate
the localization ambiguity, learn robust feature representation, and ease the
training difficulty in the early stage. We also provide the theoretical
connection between the proposed LD and the classification KD, that they share
the equivalent optimization effect. Our distillation scheme is simple as well
as effective and can be easily applied to both dense horizontal object
detectors and rotated object detectors. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO,
PASCAL VOC, and DOTA benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve
considerable AP improvement without any sacrifice on the inference speed. Our

Let $Q(n)$ denote the number of $n$-queens configurations on the classical
board and $T(n)$ the number of toroidal $n$-queens configurations. P\'{o}lya
showed that $T(n)>0$ if and only if $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$ and much more

settles a conjecture of Rivin, Vardi and Zimmmerman from 1994 regarding both

relativistic Lie algebras: de Sitter, Anti-de Sitter and Poincar\'e, which
describe the symmetries of the three maximally symmetric spacetimes. These
algebras represent the centrepiece of the kinematics of special relativity (and
its analogue in (Anti-)de Sitter spacetime), and provide the simplest framework
to build physical models in which inertial observers are equivalent. Such a
property can be expected to be preserved by Quantum Gravity, a theory which
should build a length/energy scale into the microscopic structure of spacetime.
Quantum groups, and their infinitesimal version `Lie bialgebras', allow to
encode such a scale into a noncommutativity of the algebra of functions over
the group (and over spacetime, when the group acts on a homogeneous space). In
2+1 dimensions we have evidence that the vacuum state of Quantum Gravity is one
such `noncommutative spacetime' whose symmetries are described by a Lie
bialgebra. It is then of great interest to study the possible Lie bialgebra
deformations of the relativistic Lie algebras. In this paper, we develop a
classification of such deformations in 2, 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions, based
on physical requirements based on dimensional analysis, on various degrees of
`manifest isotropy' (which implies that certain symmetries, i.e. Lorentz
transformations or rotations, are `more classical'), and on discrete symmetries
like P and T. On top of a series of new results in 3 and 4 dimensions, we find
a no-go theorem for the Lie bialgebras in 4 dimensions, which singles out the
well-known `$\kappa$-deformation' as the only one that depends on the first
power of the Planck length, or, alternatively, that possesses `manifest'
spatial isotropy.

generally, the structure of the set of periods. Define the minimum period of a
class os self-maps of a fixed set as the minimum of the positive integers such
that each map in the class has a periodic point whose period is at most this
number.
  The problem of the determination of the minimum period of the classes of
homeomorphisms of closed surfaces was completely solved, in successive steps,
from 1910 to 1996. The aim of our work is, for each compact, connected,
orientable surface, determine the minimum period of its class of
homeomorphisms. If the genus of the considered surface is zero or on, then the
problem can be solved by simple techniques. For the case of genus at least two,
we have found two upper bounds for the minimum periods, which can be expressed
as a linear function of the genus and the number of boundary components of the
surface. We give certain sufficient conditions under which these upper bounds
are achieved. In particular, we have proved that the minimum period becomes
constant for each genus, provided that the number of boundary components is
large enough. We have also studied the minimum periods of the classes of
finite-order maps.
  This thesis has three branches which are interconnected. One has to do with
the application of the fixed-point theory. One of the upper bounds of the
minimum periods is a consequence of this theory. To obtain the other upper
bound, we have also applied the Thurston-Nielsen classification of
homeomorphisms of surfaces and some of its consequences. This is the second
branch. Finally, the third branch has to do with the theory of planar
discontinuous group which provide us with the necessary tools for the
construction of examples which prove the existence of lower bounds of the
minimum periods.

Depth-wise Layering is a kind of segmentation that slices an image in a

uses a single depth image of a static scene to slice it into multiple layers.
The technique employs a thresholding approach to segment rows of the dense
depth map into smaller partitions called Line-Segments in this paper. Then, it
uses the line-segment labelling method to identify number of objects and layers
of the scene independently. The final stage is to link objects of the scene to

technique by applying that on many images along with their dense depth maps.

annotations. In this setting, the unlabeled object instances will be treated as
background, which will generate an incorrect training signal for the detector.
Interestingly, we observe that after dropping 30% of the annotations (and
labeling them as background), the performance of CNN-based object detectors
like Faster-RCNN only drops by 5% on the PASCAL VOC dataset. We provide a
detailed explanation for this result. To further bridge the performance gap, we
propose a simple yet effective solution, called Soft Sampling. Soft Sampling
re-weights the gradients of RoIs as a function of overlap with positive
instances. This ensures that the uncertain background regions are given a
smaller weight compared to the hardnegatives. Extensive experiments on curated
PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Soft Sampling
method at different annotation drop rates. Finally, we show that on
OpenImagesV3, which is a real-world dataset with missing annotations, Soft
Sampling outperforms standard detection baselines by over 3%.

phase of the collapse of a 27-solar-mass star and pay special attention to the
development of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and
neutrino-driven convection. To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic
simulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme
captures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number
exchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass
progenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who
observed strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was
suppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from
numerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant
instability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock
front. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for
large-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present
in our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing
neutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with
simpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection
is started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it
is the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical
seed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational
wave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D
general-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the
postbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to
determine the primary hydrodynamic instability.

due to the non-smooth nature of the quantile regression (QR) loss function,
which invalidates the use of existing methodology. The difficulties are
resolved through a double-smoothing approach that is applied to the local (at
each data source) and global objective functions. Despite the reliance on a
delicate combination of local and global smoothing parameters, the quantile
regression model is fully parametric, thereby facilitating interpretation. In
the low-dimensional regime, we establish a finite-sample theoretical framework
for the sequentially defined distributed QR estimators. This reveals a
trade-off between the communication cost and statistical error. We further
discuss and compare several alternative confidence set constructions, based on
inversion of Wald and score-type tests and resampling techniques, detailing an
improvement that is effective for more extreme quantile coefficients. In high
dimensions, a sparse framework is adopted, where the proposed doubly-smoothed
objective function is complemented with an $\ell_1$-penalty. We show that the
corresponding distributed penalized QR estimator achieves the global
convergence rate after a near-constant number of communication rounds. A

eliminate the influence of boundary terms. Moreover, we have incorporated
stabilization terms into the scheme to enhance its numerical effectiveness.
Notably, our resulting scheme is fully decoupled, requiring the solution of
only linear systems at each time step. We have also demonstrated the energy

advance some of the findings that have been obtained by applying the
mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics to model human decision making
under `uncertainty' in behavioral economics and finance. Starting from
Ellsberg's seminal article, decision making situations have been experimentally
verified where the application of Kolmogorovian probability in the formulation
of expected utility is problematic. Those probability measures which by
necessity must situate themselves in Hilbert space (such as `quantum
probability') enable a faithful representation of experimental data. We thus
provide an explanation for the effectiveness of the mathematical framework of
quantum mechanics in the modeling of human decision making. We want to be
explicit though that we are not claiming that decision making has microscopic
quantum mechanical features.

(SIR) method for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histopathological images
of malignant lymphoma. When a whole slide image (WSI) is used as an input
query, it is desirable to be able to retrieve similar cases by focusing on
image patches in pathologically important regions such as tumor cells. To
address this problem, we employ attention-based multiple instance learning,
which enables us to focus on tumor-specific regions when the similarity between
cases is computed. Moreover, we employ contrastive distance metric learning to
incorporate immunohistochemical (IHC) staining patterns as useful supervised
information for defining appropriate similarity between heterogeneous malignant
lymphoma cases. In the experiment with 249 malignant lymphoma patients, we
confirmed that the proposed method exhibited higher evaluation measures than
the baseline case-based SIR methods. Furthermore, the subjective evaluation by
pathologists revealed that our similarity measure using IHC staining patterns
is appropriate for representing the similarity of H&E-stained tissue images for
malignant lymphoma.

accommodate a relatively small number of dimensions, limiting the breadth of

requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing
learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated
medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust
medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised
approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,
and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to

maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided
into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user
selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission
probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet
receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully
delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for
accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a
distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between
users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is
computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial
observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel

reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its
current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used
to maximize the objective function. Game theoretic analysis of the system

These UV spectra show strong SiIV, and CIV emission, and large quantities of
sharp (~40 km/s) H2 lines. All the H2 lines belong to the Lyman band and all
the observed lines are single peaked and optically thin. The averages of all
the H2 lines centroids for each star are negative which may indicate that they
come from an outflow. We interpret the emission in H2 as being due to
fluorescence, mostly by Ly_alpha, and identify seven excitation routes within 4
A of that line. We obtain column densities (10^12 to 10^15 cm^-2) and optical
depths (~1 or less) for each exciting transition. We conclude that the
populations are far from being in thermal equilibrium. We do not observe any
lines excited from the far blue wing of Ly_alpha, which implies that the
molecular features are excited by an absorbed profile. SiIV and CIV (corrected
for H2 emission) have widths of ~200 km/s, and an array of centroids
(blueshifted lines, centered, redshifted). These characteristics are difficult
to understand in the context of current models of the accretion shock. For DR
Tau we observe transient strong blueshifted emission, perhaps the a result of
reconnection events in the magnetosphere. We also see evidence of multiple
emission regions for the hot lines. While CIV is optically thin in most stars
in our sample, SiIV is not. However, CIV is a good predictor of SiIV and H2
emission. We conclude that most of the flux in the hot lines may be due to
accretion processes, but the line profiles can have multiple and variable
components.

probe BAL variability on shorter rest-frame timescales than have previously
been explored. In a sample of 27 quasars with a median of 58 spectral epochs

exhibit significant CIV BAL equivalent-width variability on timescales of less
than 10 days in the quasar rest frame. These frequencies indicate that such
variability is common among quasars and BALs, though somewhat rare among epoch
pairs. Thus, models describing BALs and their behavior must account for
variability on timescales down to less than a day in the quasar rest frame. We
also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases,
BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other
cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density.
We adopt a simple model to constrain the density and radial distance of two
outflows appearing to vary by ionization-state changes, yielding outflow

the condition and the elusive nature of early detection. Atypical gait and
gesture patterns are dominant behavioral characteristics of autism and can
provide crucial insights for diagnosis. Furthermore, these data can be
collected efficiently in a non-intrusive way, facilitating early intervention
to optimize positive outcomes. Existing research mainly focuses on associating
facial and eye-gaze features with autism. However, very few studies have
investigated movement and gesture patterns which can reveal subtle variations
and characteristics that are specific to autism. To address this gap, we
present an analysis of gesture and gait activity in videos to identify children
with autism and quantify the severity of their condition by regressing autism
diagnostic observation schedule scores. Our proposed architecture addresses two
key factors: (1) an effective feature representation to manifest irregular
gesture patterns and (2) a two-stream co-learning framework to enable a
comprehensive understanding of its relation to autism from diverse perspectives
without explicitly using additional data modality. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing gesture and gait-activity videos for
autism analysis.

Simulations are first performed with impermeable (or solid) walls with a
one-time broadband pulse excitation applied upstream to determine the most
convectively-amplified frequencies resulting in the range 260kHz -- 400kHz,
consistent with experimental observations of second-mode instability waves.
Subsequently, we introduce harmonic disturbances via continuous periodic
suction and blowing at 270kHz and 350kHz. For each of these forcing frequencies
complex impedance boundary conditions (IBC), modeling the acoustic response of
two different carbon/carbon (C/C) ultrasonically absorptive porous surfaces,
are applied at the wall. The IBCs are derived as an output of a pore-scale
aeroacoustic analysis -- the inverse Helmholtz Solver (iHS) -- which is able to
return the broadband real and imaginary components of the surface-averaged
impedance. The introduction of the IBCs in all cases leads to a significant
attenuation of the harmonically-forced second-mode wave. In particular, we
observe a higher attenuation rate of the introduced waves with frequency of
350kHz in comparison with 270kHz, and, along with the iHS impedance results, we
establish that the C/C surfaces absorb acoustic energy more effectively at
higher frequencies.

computational systems biology. The control of RNs is currently receiving a lot
of attention because it provides a computational basis for cell reprogramming
-- an attractive technology developed in regenerative medicine. By solving the
control problem, we learn which parts of a biological system should be
perturbed to stabilise the system in the desired phenotype.
  We allow the specification of the Boolean model representing a given RN to be
incomplete. To that end, we utilise the formalism of partially specified
Boolean networks which covers every possible behaviour of unspecified parts of
the system. Such an approach causes a significant state explosion. This problem
is addressed by using symbolic methods to represent both the unspecified model
parts and all possible perturbations of the system.
  Additionally, to make the control design efficient and practically
applicable, the optimal control should be minimal in terms of size. Moreover,
in a partially specified model, a control may achieve the desired stabilisation
only for a subset of the possible fully specified model instantiations. To
address these aspects, we utilise several quantitative measures. Apart from the
size of perturbation, we also examine its robustness -- a portion of
instantiations for which the control is applicable.
  We show that proposed symbolic methods solving the control problem for
partially specified BNs are efficient and scale well. We also evaluate the
robustness metrics in cases of all three studied control types. The robustness
metric tells us how big a proportion of fully defined systems the given
perturbation works. Our experiments support the hypothesis that one-step
perturbations may be less robust than temporary or permanent perturbations.

representative type Ia supernova explosion models: a pure deflagration and a
delayed detonation. Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\beta$
processes using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with
approximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino
spectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear
supernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical
electromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,
which allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure
deflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the
addition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We
identified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak
electron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons
Co55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear
flame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron
captures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation. We
estimate that a pure deflagration supernova explosion at a distance of 1 kpc
would trigger about 14 events in the future 50 kt liquid scintillator detector
and some 19 events in a 0.5 Mt water Cherenkov-type detector. Conclusions:
While in contrast to core-collapse supernovae neutrinos carry only a very small
fraction of the energy produced in the thermonuclear supernova explosion, the
SN Ia neutrino signal provides information that allows us to unambiguously
distinguish between different possible explosion scenarios. These studies will
become feasible with the next generation of proposed neutrino observatories.

facets of quantum mechanics. To complete this task of steering quantum states,
one can employ quantum control through a sequence of generalized measurements
which direct the system towards the target state. In an active version of this
protocol, the obtained measurement readouts are used to adjust the protocol
on-the-go. This enables a sped-up performance relative to the passive version
of the protocol, where no active adjustments are included. In this work, we
consider such active measurement-driven steering as applied to the challenging
case of many-body quantum systems. For helpful decision-making strategies, we
offer Hilbert-space-orientation techniques, comparable to those used in
navigation. The first one is to tie the active-decision protocol to the greedy
accumulation of the cost function, such as the target state fidelity. We show
the potential of a significant speedup, employing this greedy approach to a
broad family of Matrix Product State targets. For system sizes considered here,
an average value of the speedup factor $f$ across this family settles about
$20$, for some targets even reaching a few thousands. We also identify a
subclass of Matrix Product State targets, for which the value of $f$ increases
with system size. In addition to the greedy approach, the second wayfinding
technique is to map out the available measurement actions onto a Quantum State
Machine. A decision-making protocol can be based on such a representation,
using semiclassical heuristics. This State Machine-based approach can be
applied to a more restricted set of targets, sometimes offering advantages over
the cost function-based method. We give an example of a W-state preparation
which is accelerated with this method by $f\simeq3.5$, outperforming the greedy

to identify covert attacks in public network. With the rapid development of
natural language processing technology in the past two years, coverless
steganography has been greatly developed. Previous text steganalysis methods
have shown unsatisfactory results on this new steganography technique and
remain an unsolved challenge. Different from all previous text steganalysis
methods, in this paper, we propose a text steganalysis method(TS-CNN) based on
semantic analysis, which uses convolutional neural network(CNN) to extract
high-level semantic features of texts, and finds the subtle distribution
differences in the semantic space before and after embedding the secret
information. To train and test the proposed model, we collected and released a
large text steganalysis(CT-Steg) dataset, which contains a total number of
216,000 texts with various lengths and various embedding rates. Experimental
results show that the proposed model can achieve nearly 100\% precision and
recall, outperforms all the previous methods. Furthermore, the proposed model
can even estimate the capacity of the hidden information inside. These results
strongly support that using the subtle changes in the semantic space before and
after embedding the secret information to conduct text steganalysis is feasible
and effective.

attention recently since abundant training samples are difficult to obtain in
practical applications. Meta-learning has been proposed to address this issue,
which focuses on quickly adapting a predictor as a base-learner to new tasks,
given limited labeled samples. However, a critical challenge for meta-learning
is the representation deficiency since it is hard to discover common
information from a small number of training samples or even one, as is the
representation of key features from such little information. As a result, a
meta-learner cannot be trained well in a high-dimensional parameter space to
generalize to new tasks. Existing methods mostly resort to extracting less
expressive features so as to avoid the representation deficiency. Aiming at
learning better representations, we propose a meta-learning approach with
complemented representations network (MCRNet) for few-shot image
classification. In particular, we embed a latent space, where latent codes are
reconstructed with extra representation information to complement the
representation deficiency. Furthermore, the latent space is established with
variational inference, collaborating well with different base-learners, and can
be extended to other models. Finally, our end-to-end framework achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in image classification on three standard few-shot
learning datasets.

observations producing time-series data. While often this data is analysed

method of converting oscillatory data into audible sound is audification -- a
one-to-one mapping of data samples to audio samples -- which has the benefit
that no information is lost, thus is a true representation of the original
data. However, audification can make some magnetospheric ULF waves observations
pass by too quickly for someone to realistically be able to listen to

language models (LLM), enabling few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Black-box
prompt search has received growing interest recently for its distinctive
properties of gradient-free optimization, proven particularly useful and
powerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the
complexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern
black-box approaches. Despite extensive research on search algorithms, the
crucial aspect of search space design and optimization has been largely
overlooked. In this paper, we first conduct a sensitivity analysis by prompting
LLM, revealing that only a small number of tokens exert a disproportionate
amount of influence on LLM predictions. Leveraging this insight, we propose the
Clustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple
black-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to
focus exclusively on influential prompt tokens. By employing even simple search
methods within the pruned search space, ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks and LLMs, surpassing the performance of
complex approaches while significantly reducing search costs. Our findings

integers without collisions. There is a lower bound of n*log(e)=1.44n bits
needed to represent an MPHF. This can be reached by a brute-force algorithm
that tries e^n hash function seeds in expectation and stores the first seed
leading to an MPHF. The most space-efficient previous algorithms for
constructing MPHFs all use such a brute-force approach as a basic building
block.
  In this paper, we introduce ShockHash - Small, heavily overloaded cuckoo hash
tables for minimal perfect hashing. ShockHash uses two hash functions h_0 and
h_1, hoping for the existence of a function f : S->{0, 1} such that x ->
h_{f(x)}(x) is an MPHF on S. It then uses a 1-bit retrieval data structure to
store f using n + o(n) bits.
  In graph terminology, ShockHash generates n-edge random graphs until
stumbling on a pseudoforest - where each component contains as many edges as
nodes. Using cuckoo hashing, ShockHash then derives an MPHF from the
pseudoforest in linear time. We show that ShockHash needs to try only about
(e/2)^n=1.359^n seeds in expectation. This reduces the space for storing the
seed by roughly n bits (maintaining the asymptotically optimal space
consumption) and speeds up construction by almost a factor of 2^n compared to
brute-force. Bipartite ShockHash reduces the expected construction time again
to 1.166^n by maintaining a pool of candidate hash functions and checking all
possible pairs.
  ShockHash as a building block within the RecSplit framework can be
constructed up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches. It
can build an MPHF for 10 million keys with 1.489 bits per key in about half an
hour. When instead using ShockHash after an efficient k-perfect hash function,
it achieves space usage similar to the best competitors, while being
significantly faster to construct and query.

with a spatially modulated, but disorder-free time evolution operator. Instead
of complete scrambling, the excitations of the system remain well-defined.
Their propagation is analogous to the evolution along light cones in a curved
space-time obtained by two Schwarzschild black holes. The Hawking temperature
serves as an order parameter which distinguishes between heating and
non-heating phases. Beyond a time scale determined by the inverse Hawking
temperature, excitations are absorbed by the black holes resulting in a
singular concentration of energy at their center. We obtain these results

measure comprising independent samples from an absolutely continuous
distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ converges to that distribution at the rate
$n^{-1/d}$ in Wasserstein distance, which can be used to prove that plug-in
estimators of many optimal transport costs converge at this same rate. However,
we show that when the cost is smooth, this analysis is loose: plug-in
estimators based on empirical measures converge quadratically faster, at the
rate $n^{-2/d}$. As a corollary, we show that the Wasserstein distance between
two distributions is significantly easier to estimate when the measures are
well-separated. We also prove lower bounds, showing not only that our analysis
of the plug-in estimator is tight, but also that no other estimator can enjoy
significantly faster rates of convergence uniformly over all pairs of measures.
Our proofs rely on empirical process theory arguments based on tight control of
$L^2$ covering numbers for locally Lipschitz and semi-concave functions. As a
byproduct of our proofs, we derive $L^\infty$ estimates on the displacement

variances from those of maximum likelihood estimation. Many variables that

parameters at each point. Rather than shrinking these towards zero, nearby
parameters are better shrunk towards each other. Semiparametric regression is a
statistical discipline for building curves across parameter classes using
shrinkage methodology. It is similar to but more parsimonious than cubic
splines. We introduce it in the context of Bayesian shrinkage and apply it to
joint mortality modeling for related populations. Bayesian shrinkage of slope
changes of linear splines is an approach to semiparametric modeling that
evolved in the actuarial literature. It has some theoretical and practical
advantages, like closed-form curves, direct and transparent determination of
degree of shrinkage and of placing knots for the splines, and quantifying
goodness of fit. It is also relatively easy to apply to the many nonlinear
models that arise in actuarial work. We find that it compares well to a more
complex state-of-the-art statistical spline shrinkage approach on a popular

the HCS is unstable to long enough wavelength perturbation. As a second

foundations, and it can be applied to both classical and quantum systems. We
show that a duality principle between the NMZ formulation in the space of
observables and in the state space can be established, analogous to the
Heisenberg and Schr\""odinger pictures in quantum mechanics. Based on this
duality we prove that, under natural assumptions, the projection operators
appearing in the NMZ equation must be conditional expectations. The proposed

develop a new generation of methods which can take into account a space variant
Point Spread Function (PSF) and have to be at the same time accurate and fast.
We investigate in this paper how Deep Learning (DL) could be used to perform
this task. We employ a U-Net Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture to learn in
a supervised setting parameters adapted for galaxy image processing and study
two strategies for deconvolution. The first approach is a post-processing of a
mere Tikhonov deconvolution with closed form solution and the second one is an
iterative deconvolution framework based on the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). Our numerical results based on GREAT3 simulations with
realistic galaxy images and PSFs show that our two approaches outperforms
standard techniques based on convex optimization, whether assessed in galaxy
image reconstruction or shape recovery. The approach based on Tikhonov
deconvolution leads to the most accurate results except for ellipticity errors
at high signal to noise ratio where the ADMM approach performs slightly better,
is also more computation-time efficient to process a large number of galaxies,
and is therefore recommended in this scenario.

personnel leaving the project. This risk is exacerbated in large projects that
have been under development for a long time and experienced growth in their
development teams. One way to quantify this risk is to measure the
concentration of knowledge about the project among its developers. Formally
known as the Bus Factor (BF) of a project and defined as 'the number of key
developers who would need to be incapacitated to make a project unable to
proceed'. Most of the proposed algorithms for BF calculation measure a
developer's knowledge of a file based on the number of commits. In this work,
we propose using other metrics like lines of code changes (LOCC) and cosine
difference of lines of code (change-size-cos) to calculate the BF. We use these
metrics for BF calculation for five open-source GitHub projects using the CST
algorithm and the RIG algorithm, which is git-blame-based. Moreover, we
calculate the BF on project sub-directories that have seen the most active
development recently. Lastly, we compare the results of the two algorithms in
accuracy, similarity in results, execution time, and trends in BF values over
time.

partial-wetting regime implies the boundary condition $\partial_y h =

microscopic contact angle). Existence and uniqueness of traveling-wave
solutions to this problem under the constraint $\partial_y^2 h \to 0$ as $h \to

[Commun. Appl. Ind. Math., 2(2):e-388, 16, 2011]. We are interested in the
asymptotics as $h \downarrow 0$ and $h \to \infty$. By reformulating the
problem as $h \downarrow 0$ as a dynamical system for the difference between
the solution and the microscopic contact angle, values for $n$ are found for
which linear as well as nonlinear resonances occur. These resonances lead to a
different asymptotic behavior of the solution as $h\downarrow0$ depending on
$n$.
  Together with the asymptotics as $h\to\infty$ characterizing the Cox-Voinov
law for the velocity-dependent macroscopic contact angle as found by
Giacomelli, the first author of this work, and Otto in [Nonlinearity,
29(9):2497-2536, 2016], the rigorous asymptotics of traveling-wave solutions to
the thin-film equation in partial wetting can be characterized. Furthermore,
our approach enables us to analyze the relation between the microscopic and
macroscopic contact angle. It is found that the Cox-Voinov law for the
macroscopic contact angle depends continuously differentiably on the
microscopic contact angle.

threshold-based approaches. Under suitable conditions, exceedances over a high
threshold have been shown to follow the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)
asymptotically. In practice, however, the threshold must be chosen. If the
chosen threshold is too low, the GPD approximation may not hold and bias can
occur. If the threshold is chosen too high, reduced sample size increases the
variance of parameter estimates. To process batch analyses, commonly used
selection methods such as graphical diagnosis are subjective and cannot be
automated, while computational methods may not be feasible. We propose to test
a set of thresholds through the goodness-of-fit of the GPD for the exceedances,
and select the lowest one, above which the data provides adequate fit to the
GPD. Previous attempts in this setting are not valid due to the special feature
that the multiple tests are done in an ordered fashion. We apply two recently
available stopping rules that control the false discovery rate or familywise
error rate to ordered goodness-of-fit tests to automate threshold selection.
Various model specification tests such as the Cramer-von Mises,
Anderson-Darling, Moran's, and a score test are investigated. The performance
of the method is assessed in a large scale simulation study that mimics
practical return level estimation. This procedure was repeated at hundreds of
sites in the western US to generate return level maps of extreme precipitation.

empirical likelihood based on the construction of blocks of increasing
nonrandom length have been proposed for time series satisfying mixing
conditions. Following some recent developments in the bootstrap literature, we
propose a generalization for a large class of Markov chains, based on small
blocks of various lengths. Our approach makes use of the regenerative structure
of Markov chains, which allows us to construct blocks which are almost
independent (independent in the atomic case). We obtain the asymptotic validity
of the method for positive recurrent Markov chains and present some simulation

graphs have received much interest recently, owing in part to their wide
applicability in various domains including recommender systems, social
networks, secure sensor networks, clustering and classification analysis, and
cryptanalysis to name a few. In this paper, we study connectivity properties of
random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links. Unreliability of the
edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering edges
of the graph to be on or off independently from each other. The resulting model
is an intersection of a random key graph and an Erdos-Renyi graph, and is
expected to be useful in capturing various real-world networks; e.g., with
secure WSN applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh
environmental conditions severely impairing transmissions. We present
conditions on how to scale this model's parameters so that i) the minimum node
degree in the graph is at least k, and ii) the graph is k-connected, both with
high probability as the number of nodes becomes large. The results are given in
the form of zeroone laws with critical thresholds identified and shown to

Asymmetric mixtures feature spatial mixing among the involved components with
the more strongly interacting or heavier one exhibiting flat-top structures.
Applying quenches on the harmonic trap we trigger the lowest-lying collective
droplet excitations. The interaction-dependent breathing frequency, being
slightly reduced in the presence of correlations, shows a decreasing trend for
stronger attractions. Semi-analytical predictions are also obtained within the
Lee-Huang-Yang framework. For relatively large quench amplitudes the droplet
progressively delocalizes and higher-lying motional excitations develop in its
core. Simultaneously, enhanced intercomponent entanglement and long-range
two-body intracomponent correlations arise. In sharp contrast, the dipole
motion remains robust irrespectively of the system parameters. Species
selective quenches lead to a correlation-induced dephasing of the droplet or to
irregular dipole patterns due to intercomponent collisions.

literature. Fractal geometry as a modern mathematical approach and a new
geometrical viewpoint on natural objects including both processes and
structures was employed for analysis of literature. As the first study, the
works of William Shakespeare were chosen as the most important items in western
literature. By counting the number of letters applied in a manuscript, it is
possible to study the whole manuscript statistically. A novel method based on
basic assumption of fractal geometry was proposed for the calculation of
fractal dimensions of the literature. The results were compared with Zipf's
law. Zipf's law was successfully used for letters instead of words. Two new
concepts namely Zipf's dimension and Zipf's order were also introduced. It was
found that changes of both fractal dimension and Zipf's dimension are similar
and dependent on the manuscript length. Interestingly, direct plotting the data
obtained in semi-logarithmic and logarithmic forms also led to a power-law.

degree, emitting carbon at a similar magnitude to oil refineries or landfill
sites. A lack of tools for rapid and reliable assessment of peatland condition
has limited monitoring of vast areas of peatland and prevented targeting areas
urgently needing action to halt further degradation. Measured using
interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), peatland surface motion is
highly indicative of peatland condition, largely driven by the eco-hydrological
change in the peatland causing swelling and shrinking of the peat substrate.
The computational intensity of recent methods using InSAR time series to
capture the annual functional structure of peatland surface motion becomes
increasingly challenging as the sample size increases. Instead, we utilize the
behavior of the entire peatland surface motion time series using object
oriented data analysis to assess peatland condition. In a Gibbs sampling
scheme, our cluster analysis based on the functional behavior of the surface
motion time series finds features representative of soft/wet peatlands,
drier/shrubby peatlands and thin/modified peatlands align with the clusters.
The posterior distribution of the assigned peatland types enables the scale of
peatland degradation to be assessed, which will guide future cost-effective
decisions for peatland restoration.

edges. For our models, these edge modes develop and extend to twice the orbital
radius of a Saturn mass planet in discs with disc-to-star mass ratio >0.06,
corresponding to a Toomre Q < 1.5 at the outer disc boundary. Unlike the local
vortex-forming instabilities associated with gap edges in weakly or
non-self-gravitating low viscosity discs, the edge modes are global and exist
only in sufficiently massive discs, but for the typical viscosity values
adopted for protoplanetary discs. Analytic modelling and linear calculations
show edge modes may be interpreted as a localised disturbance associated with a
gap edge inducing activity in the extended disc, through the launching of
density waves excited at Lindblad resonances. Nonlinear hydrodynamic
simulations are performed to investigate the evolution of edge modes in
disc-planet systems. The form and growth rates of unstable modes are consistent
with linear theory. Their dependence on viscosity and gravitational softening
is also explored. We also performed a first study of the effect of edge modes
on planetary migration. We found that if edge modes develop, then the average
disc-on-planet torque becomes more positive with increasing disc mass. In
simulations where the planet was allowed to migrate, although a fast type III
migration could be seen that was similar to that seen in non-self-gravitating
discs, we found that it was possible for the planet to interact gravitationally
with the spiral arms associated with an edge mode and that this could result in
the planet being scattered outwards. Thus orbital migration is likely to be
complex and non monotonic in massive discs of the type we consider.

the interface between BCS superconductors and other materials. The detection of
odd-$\omega$ pairs, which are necessarily non-local in time, is still an open
problem. The main reason is that they do not contribute to static measurements
described by time-local correlation functions. Therefore, dynamical
measurements, which depend on non-local time correlations, are suitable for
detecting these pairs. In this work, we study the signatures of odd-$\omega$
pairs in the supercurrent noise through a weak link between two superconductors
at different superconducting phases. We show that the finite frequency current
noise can be decomposed into three different contributions coming from even
frequency (even-$\omega$), odd-$\omega$ pair amplitudes, and electron-hole
correlation functions. Odd-$\omega$ pairing, which is inter-lead (between
electrons at different sides of the junction), provides a positive contribution
to the noise, becoming maximal at a superconducting phase difference of $\pi$.
In contrast, intra-lead even-$\omega$ pair amplitude tends to reduce the noise,
except for a region close to $\pi$, controlled by the transmission of the
junction.

terms of correlations in the spike activity of different neurons. Open

leads to higher-order correlations -- correlations in the population activity
that extend beyond those expected from cell pairs? Here, we examine this
question for a simple, but ubiquitous, circuit feature: common fluctuating
input arriving to spiking neurons of integrate-and-fire type. We show that
leads to strong higher-order correlations, as for earlier work with discrete
threshold crossing models. Moreover, we find that the same is true for another
widely used, doubly-stochastic model of neural spiking, the linear-nonlinear
cascade. We explain the surprisingly strong connection between the collective
dynamics produced by these models, and conclude that higher-order correlations
are both broadly expected and possible to capture with surprising accuracy by
simplified (and tractable) descriptions of neural spiking.

sentence description for each topic which in turn makes the generated summary
more informative and diverse. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed
LSA-based sentence selection algorithm, extensive experiment on Arabic and

design of these interpolations overcomes the difficulty caused by the lack of

Traditional spectral clustering techniques discover clusters by processing a
similarity matrix that reflects the proximity of objects. For multi-scale data,
distance-based similarity is not effective because objects of a sparse cluster
could be far apart while those of a dense cluster have to be sufficiently
close. Following [16], we solve the problem of spectral clustering on
multi-scale data by integrating the concept of objects' ""reachability
similarity"" with a given distance-based similarity to derive an objects'
coefficient matrix. We propose the algorithm CAST that applies trace Lasso to
regularize the coefficient matrix. We prove that the resulting coefficient
matrix has the ""grouping effect"" and that it exhibits ""sparsity"". We show that
these two characteristics imply very effective spectral clustering. We evaluate
CAST and 10 other clustering methods on a wide range of datasets w.r.t. various

and is highly robust across test cases of multi-scale data.

stellar evolution, as asteroseismology has opened up a window into their
interiors. Such insights are a direct result of the unprecedented data from
space missions Kepler and CoRoT as well as recent theoretical advances.
Eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects, and when coupled
with asteroseismology, binaries would provide two independent methods to obtain
masses and radii and exciting opportunities to develop highly constrained
stellar models. The possibility of discovering pulsating red giants in
eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially
offer very robust characterization of these systems. Hitherto, only 1 case has
been discovered with Kepler. We cross-correlated the detected red-giant and
eclipsing-binary catalogs from Kepler data to find candidate systems.
Light-curve modeling and mean asteroseismic properties are combined to yield
measurements of periods, masses, radii, temperatures, eclipse timing
variations, core rotation rates, and red-giant evolutionary state. After
elimination of false positives, out of the 70 systems common to the red-giant
and eclipsing-binary catalogs we find 13 new strong candidates that are
pulsating red giants in eclipsing binaries, and 10 more that are pulsating red
giants in hierarchical triple systems. The systems span a range of orbital
eccentricities, periods, and spectral types for the red-giant companion. One
case even suggests a system composed of two red-giants. The discovery of
pulsating red giants in multiple systems provides exciting test beds for
precise astrophysical modeling, and follow-up spectroscopic observations of the
candidate systems are encouraged.

fraud patterns and scarce labeled data. Existing methods predominantly rely on
graph-based or sequence-based approaches. While graph-based approaches connect
users through shared entities to capture structural information, they remain
vulnerable to fraudsters who can disrupt or manipulate these connections. In
contrast, sequence-based approaches analyze users' behavioral patterns,
offering robustness against tampering but overlooking the interactions between
similar users. Inspired by cohort analysis in retention and healthcare, this
paper introduces VecAug, a novel cohort-augmented learning framework that
addresses these challenges by enhancing the representation learning of target
users with personalized cohort information. To this end, we first propose a
vector burn-in technique for automatic cohort identification, which retrieves a
task-specific cohort for each target user. Then, to fully exploit the cohort
information, we introduce an attentive cohort aggregation technique for
augmenting target user representations. To improve the robustness of such
cohort augmentation, we also propose a novel label-aware cohort neighbor
separation mechanism to distance negative cohort neighbors and calibrate the
aggregated cohort information. By integrating this cohort information with
target user representations, VecAug enhances the modeling capacity and
generalization capabilities of the model to be augmented. Our framework is
flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing fraud detection models.
We deploy our framework on e-commerce platforms and evaluate it on three fraud
detection datasets, and results show that VecAug improves the detection

superconductivity nucleation in hybrid structures consisting of the
semiconducting nanowires placed in contact with a thin superconducting film and
discuss the resulting restrictions on the operation of Majorana-based devices.
A strong paramagnetic effect for electrons entering the semiconductor together
with spin-orbit coupling and van Hove singularities in the electronic density
of states in the wire are responsible for the suppression of superconducting
correlations in the low field domain and for the reentrant superconductivity at
high magnetic fields in the topologically nontrivial regime. The growth of the
critical temperature in the latter case continues up to the upper critical
field destroying the pairing inside the superconducting film due to either
orbital or paramagnetic mechanism. The suppression of the homogeneous
superconducting state near the boundary between the topological and
non-topological regimes provides the conditions favorable for the
Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov instability.

(ST) technology to help them adopt healthier habits with a focus on breaking
their sedentary lifestyle and staying fit. However, there is scarce evidence of
such technological interventions' effectiveness, and there are no standardized
methods to evaluate their impact on people's physical activity (PA) and health.
This work aims to help ST practitioners and researchers by empowering them with
systematic guidelines and a framework for designing and evaluating
technological interventions to facilitate health behavior change (HBC) and user
engagement (UE), focusing on increasing PA and decreasing sedentariness. To
this end, we conduct a literature review of 129 papers between 2008 and 2022,
which identifies the core ST HCI design methods and their efficacy, as well as
the most comprehensive list to date of UE evaluation metrics for ST. Based on
the review's findings, we propose PAST SELF, a framework to guide the design
and evaluation of ST technology that has potential applications in industrial
and scientific settings. Finally, to facilitate researchers and practitioners,
we complement this paper with an open corpus and an online, adaptive
exploration tool for the PAST SELF data.

and star-forming galaxies, leave their imprint on the gamma-ray sky as nearly
isotropic emission referred to as the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Background (EGB).
While the brightest of these sources may be individually resolved, their
fainter counterparts contribute diffusely. In this work, we use a
recently-developed analysis method, called the Non-Poissonian Template Fit, on
up to 93 months of publicly-available data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope
to determine the properties of the point sources that comprise the EGB. This
analysis takes advantage of photon-count statistics to probe the aggregate
properties of these source populations below the sensitivity threshold of
published catalogs. We measure the source-count distributions and point-source
intensities, as a function of energy, from 2 GeV to 2 TeV. We find that the EGB
is dominated by point sources, likely blazars, in all seven energy sub-bins
considered. These results have implications for the interpretation of IceCube's
PeV neutrinos, which may originate from sources that contribute to the

derive modified fluctuation-dissipation theorems near non-equilibrium
stationary states used by J. Prost et al., PRL 103, 090601 (2009), is
generalizable to non-stationary states. This result follows from both standard
linear response theory and from a transient fluctuation theorem, analogous to
the Hatano-Sasa relation. We show that this modified fluctuation-dissipation
theorem can be interpreted at the trajectory level using the notion of
stochastic trajectory entropy, in a way which is similar to what has been done
recently in the case of MFDT near non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). We
illustrate this framework with two solvable examples: the first example
corresponds to a brownian particle in an harmonic trap submitted to a quench of
temperature and to a time-dependent stiffness. The second example is a classic
model of coarsening systems, namely the 1D Ising model with Glauber dynamics.

For example, free
samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or
""seed nodes""), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it.
One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or
IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed
budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is
maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user
influences another one. However, this probability information may be
unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of
complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online
Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same
time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial
approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence
information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and
(3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the
Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current
influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the
estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework.
We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the
overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our
solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial
information.

strategy for reducing the number of measurements (i.e., shots) by randomly
sampling operators $h_i$ from the overall Hamiltonian $H = \sum_i c_i h_i$. In
particular, we employ weighted sampling, which is important when the $c_i$'s
are highly non-uniform, as is typical in chemistry. We integrate this strategy
with an adaptive optimizer developed recently by our group to construct an
improved optimizer called Rosalin (Random Operator Sampling for Adaptive
Learning with Individual Number of shots). Rosalin implements stochastic
gradient descent while adapting the shot noise for each partial derivative and
randomly assigning the shots amongst the $h_i$ according to a weighted
distribution. We implement this and other optimizers to find the ground states
of molecules H$_2$, LiH, and BeH$_2$, without and with quantum hardware noise,

peaks in prolately deformed nuclei. When a nucleus is triaxially deformed, a
peak appears in the middle between the two peaks.
  Purpose: We investigate the mechanism of the appearance of the middle peak in
the ISGMR in triaxial nuclei.
  Method: We perform the constrained Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (CHFB)
calculation for arbitrary triaxial shapes in $^{100}$Mo. We calculate the
strength functions of the isoscalar monopole (ISM) and IS quadrupole modes on
the CHFB states. Furthermore, we investigate vibrations of matter distributions
in $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions induced by the external ISM field, with the $z$
axis being the longest axis of the triaxial shape.
  Results: The middle peak in the ISM strength evolves from the triaxial degree
$\gamma=0^\circ$ to $60^\circ$. This is because the difference between the
vibration in $x$ direction and that in $y$ direction is evident with an
increase in $\gamma$ and the quadrupole $K=2$ component of the induced density
of the ISM at the middle peak increases as $\gamma$ increases, where $K$
denotes the $z$ component of the angular momentum. This property is also
obtained in the unperturbed ISM strength without the residual fields.
  Conclusions: The mixing between the monopole and quadrupole modes is
primarily determined by the ground-state deformation. Therefore, the ISM
strength of the middle peak becomes strong as the triaxial degree in the ground
state increases.

faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what faithfulness is
exactly, and what its properties are. We begin by showing that existing metrics
are not interchangeable -- i.e., explanations attaining high faithfulness
according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can be
systematically insensitive to important properties of the explanation, and
suggest how to address these issues. We proceed to show that, surprisingly,
optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal. Specifically,
we show that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful
explanations are completely uninformative. The situation is different for
modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures,
where optimizing faithfulness does not compromise informativeness, and is also

to know which symmetry groups can be implemented via the scalar sector. In

finite symmetry groups of Higgs-family transformations in the

self consistent dressing by collective gravitational interaction of the
colliding particles, for the system's inhomogeneity and for different
constituent's masses. The evolution of the one-body distribution function is
described in action angle space. The collision operators are expressed in terms
of the collective response function allowed by the existing distribution
functions at any given time and involve particles in resonant motions. The set
of equations which describe the coupled evolution of the distribution functions
and of the potential is derived for spherical systems. In the homogeneous

the conditional class probability is formulated as difference of corresponding
cumulative distribution functions, where the cumulative distribution functions
can be converted from the estimated conditional quantile regression functions.
The proposed estimation method is also efficient as its computation cost does
not increase exponentially with the number of classes. The theoretical and

correlated random shear flows, modeled in terms of Ornstein-Uhlembeck

an intrinsic time scale of the reaction dynamics (the wrinkling time $t_w$) is
crucial in determining both the front propagation speed and the front spatial

discussed in the light of the bending phenomenon, i.e. the decrease of

outcomes. We then derive sharp bounds on the average treatment effects under
this assumption. Our framework encompasses the popular marginal sensitivity
model as a special case, and we demonstrate how the proposed methodology can
address a primary challenge of the marginal sensitivity model that it produces
uninformative results when unobserved confounders substantially affect
treatment and outcome. Specifically, we develop an alternative sensitivity
model, called the distributional sensitivity model, under the assumption that
heterogeneity of treatment effect due to unobserved variables is relatively
small. Unlike the marginal sensitivity model, the distributional sensitivity
model allows for potential lack of overlap and often produces informative
bounds even when unobserved variables substantially affect both treatment and
outcome. Finally, we show how to extend the distributional sensitivity model to
difference-in-differences designs and settings with instrumental variables.

sequence represents not only pronunciation but also language-dependent

information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory
footprint. For the tractability of training, existing generative-hashing
methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution,
enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of
both model representation and code space size, independence is always not the
best assumption. In this paper, to introduce correlations among the bits of
hash codes, we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the
variational posterior. To address the intractability issue of training, we
first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a
Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a
Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. Based on that, an
asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower
bound (ELBO). With these novel techniques, the entire model can be optimized
efficiently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by effectively
modeling correlations among different bits within a hash code, our model can
achieve significant performance gains.

contiguous fits to the EE tail and the later X-ray plateau, unified within a
single model. Our central engine is a magnetar surrounded by a fall-back
accretion disc, formed by either the merger of two compact objects or the
accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. During the EE phase, material is
accelerated to super-Keplarian velocities and ejected from the system by the
rapidly rotating ($P \approx 1 - 10$ ms) and very strong ($10^{15}$ G) magnetic
field in a process known as magnetic propellering. The X-ray plateau is
modelled as magnetic dipole spin-down emission. We first explore the range of
GRB phenomena that the propeller could potentially reproduce, using a series of
template light curves to devise a classification scheme based on phenomology.
We then obtain fits to the light curves of 9 GRBs with EE, simultaneously
fitting both the propeller and the magnetic dipole spin-down and finding
typical disc masses of a few $10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ to a few $10^{-2}$
$M_{\odot}$. This is done for ballistic, viscous disc and exponential accretion
rates. We find that the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy to EM
emission for propellered material needs to be $\gtrsim 10\%$ and that the best
fitting results come from an exponential accretion profile.

algorithm as decoder. The proposed technique is applied to numerical and
experimental datasets including the fluidic pinball, a swirling jet, and the
wake behind a couple of tandem cylinders. Analyzing the fluidic pinball, the
manifold is able to describe the pitchfork bifurcation and the chaotic regime
with only three feature coordinates. These coordinates are linked to
vortex-shedding phases and the force coefficients. The manifold coordinates of
the swirling jet are comparable to the POD mode amplitudes, yet allow for a
more distinct manifold identification which is less sensitive to measurement
noise. As similar observation is made for the wake of two tandem cylinders
(Raiola et al., 2016). The tandem cylinders are aligned in streamwise distance
which corresponds to the transition between the single bluff body and the
reattachment regimes of vortex shedding. Isomap unveils these two shedding
regimes while the Lissajous plots of first two POD mode amplitudes feature a
single circle. The reconstruction error of the manifold model is small compared
to the fluctuation level, indicating that the low embedding dimensions contains
the coherent structure dynamics. The proposed Isomap-KNN manifold learner is
expected to be of large importance in estimation, dynamic modeling and control
for large range of configurations with dominant coherent structures.

transport properties in finite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains. A set
of particles freely hop between nearest-neighbor sites, with the additional
condition that, when two particles meet, they merge instantaneously into one
particle. A localized source of particle-current is imposed at the origin as
well as a non-symmetric hopping rate between the left and right directions
(particle drift). This model was previously studied with exact results for the
particle density by Hinrichsen et al. [1] in the long-time limit. We are
interested here in the crossover process between a scaling regime and long-time
behavior, starting with a chain filled of particles. As in the previous
reference [1], we employ the empty-interval-particle method, where the
probability of finding an empty interval between two given sites is considered.
However a different method is developed here to treat the boundary conditions
by imposing the continuity and differentiability of the interval probability,
which allows for a closed and unique solution, especially for any given initial
particle configuration. In the finite size case, we find a crossover between
the scaling regime and two different exponential decays for the particle
density as function of the input current. Precise asymptotic expressions for
the particle-density, and coagulation rate are given.

view, restricting oneself to either substance or process ontology would be as
ill-advised as exclusively relying on position or momentum observables in
physics. A new view on Zeno's paradox lends itself. The meaning of an ""internal
energy observable"", complementary to inner time, and its relationship to
""akategorial states"" of the human mind will also be discussed.

average of the 4-center MCI values along the ring that keep a positional
relationship of 1,2,4,5. AV1245 measures the extent of transferability of the
delocalized electrons between bonds 1-2 and 4-5, which is expected to be large
in conjugated circuits and, therefore, in aromatic molecules. A new algorithm
for the calculation of MCI for large rings is also introduced and used to
produce the data for the calibration of the new aromaticity index. AV1245 does
not rely on reference values, does not suffer from large numerical precision
errors, and it does not present any limitation on the nature of atoms, the
molecular geometry or the level of calculation. It is a size-extensive measure
with a small computational cost that grows linearly with the number of ring
members. Therefore, it is specially suitable to study the aromaticity of large
molecular rings as those occurring in belt-shaped M\""obius structures or
porphyrins.

methods, namely, (i) exploit covariates to improve the quality of communities,
and more importantly, (ii) explain the discovered communities by identifying
the relative importance of different covariates in them. Recent methods have
almost exclusively focused on the first point above. However, the quantitative
improvements offered by them are often due to complex black-box models like
deep neural networks at the expense of explainability. Approaches that focus on
the second point are either domain-specific or have poor performance in
practice. This paper proposes explainable, domain-independent statistical
models for networks with node covariates that additionally offer good
quantitative performance. Our models combine the strengths of Stochastic Block
Models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines to provide interpretable insights
about the communities. They support both pure and mixed community memberships.
Besides providing explainability, our approach's main strength is that it does
not explicitly assume a causal direction between community memberships and node
covariates, making it applicable in diverse domains. We derive efficient
inference procedures for our models, which can, in some cases, run in linear
time in the number of nodes and edges. Experiments on several synthetic and
real-world networks demonstrate that our models achieve close to
state-of-the-art performance on community detection and link prediction tasks
while also providing explanations for the discovered communities.

events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical flux
significantly fainter than expected from the observed X-ray afterglow. We find
that out of a uniform sample of 29 Swift bursts rapidly observed by the Palomar
60-inch telescope through March 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), all
events have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxy
detection, or both. Our results constrain the fraction of Swift GRBs coming
from very high redshift (z > 7), such as the recent GRB 090423, to between
0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. In contrast, a significant fraction of the
sample requires large extinction columns (host-frame A_V > 1 mag, with several
events showing A_V > 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominant
cause of the dark GRB phenomenon. We infer that a significant fraction of GRBs
(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscured
regions. However, the host galaxies of dark GRBs seem to have normal optical
colors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinity
of the GRB progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

\gamma_2-\gamma_1$ and $\Delta\gamma_{31}\equiv \gamma_3-\gamma_1$, where
$\gamma_i$'s denote the coupling of neutrino mass eigenstates to gravitational
field. By analyzing the latest muon-tracks data sets of IceCube-40 and
IceCube-79, besides providing the 2D allowed regions in
$(\phi\Delta\gamma_{21},\phi\Delta\gamma_{31})$ plane, we obtain the upper
limits $|\phi\Delta\gamma_{21}| < 9.1\times 10^{-27}$ (at 90\% C.L.) which
improves the previous limit by $\sim4$ orders of magnitude and
$|\phi\Delta\gamma_{31}| \lesssim 6\times 10^{-27}$ (at 90\% C.L.) which
improves the current limit by $\sim1$ order of magnitude. Also we discuss in
detail and analytically the effect of VEP on neutrino oscillation

lying between the Galactic Plane and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It was
first detected at 888 MHz with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP), and with a diameter of ~196 arcsec. This source has phenomenological
similarities to Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). Significant differences to the known
ORCs - a flatter radio spectral index, the lack of a prominent central galaxy
as a possible host, and larger apparent size - suggest that J0624-6948 may be a
different type of object. We argue that the most plausible explanation for
J0624-6948 is an intergalactic supernova remnant due to a star that resided in
the LMC outskirts that had undergone a single-degenerate type Ia supernova, and
we are seeing its remnant expand into a rarefied, intergalactic environment. We
also examine if a massive star or a white dwarf binary ejected from either
galaxy could be the supernova progenitor. Finally, we consider several other
hypotheses for the nature of the object, including the jets of an active
galactic nucleus (AGN) or the remnant of a nearby stellar super-flare.

Furthermore, proposed network models predict spatial regularities in the firing

this paper, by analyzing the response of grid cells recorded from rats during
free navigation, we first show that there are strong variations in the mean
firing rate of the fields of individual grid cells and thus show that the data
is inconsistent with the theoretical models that predict similar peak
magnitudes. We then build a two population excitatory-inhibitory network model
in which sparse spatially selective input to the excitatory cells, presumed to
arise from e.g. salient external stimuli, hippocampus or a combination of both,
leads to the variability in the firing field amplitudes of grid cells. We show
that, when combined with appropriate connectivity between the excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, the variability in the firing field amplitudes of grid
cells results in inhibitory neurons that do not exhibit regular spatial firing,
consistent with experimental data. Finally, we show that even if the spatial
positions of the fields are maintained, variations in the firing rates of the

low-mass main-sequence stars. Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to
constrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their
properties evolve with time on the main-sequence.
  Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed
rotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters
in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar
mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed
in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the
main-sequence.
  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters
as $\dot{M}_\star \propto R_\star^2 \Omega_\star^{1.33} M_\star^{-3.36}$. We
estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is
an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to
the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of
this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the
spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at
a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age.
  Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution
of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of
stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the
sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions,
these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution
of planetary environments.

nanoparticle (NP), indicative of the induction of DNA lesions, a potential
trigger for cell-death. Monte Carlo track structure simulations were performed
to determine (a) the fluence of incident photons and electrons in water around
a gold NP under charged particle equilibrium conditions and (b) the density of
ionization clusters produced on average as well as conditional on the
occurrence of at least one interaction in the nanoparticle using Associated
Volume Clustering. Absorbed dose was determined for comparison with a recent
benchmark intercomparison. Reported quantities are normalized to primary
fluence, allowing to establish a connection to macroscopic dosimetric
quantities. The modification of the electron fluence spectrum by the gold NP is
minor and mainly occurs at low energies. The net fluence of electrons emitted
from the NP is dominated by electrons resulting from photon interactions.
Smaller NPs cause noticeable peaks in the conditional frequency of clusters at
distances around 50 nm to 100 nm from the NP surface. The number of clusters
per energy imparted is increased at distances of up to 150 nm, and accordingly
the enhancement in clustering notably surpasses that of dose enhancement. This
work highlights the necessity of nanodosimetric analysis and suggests increased
ionization clustering near the nanoparticles due to the emission of low energy
Auger electrons. Whereas the electron component of the radiation field plays an
important role in determining the background contribution to ionization
clustering and energy imparted, the dosimetric effects of nanoparticles are
governed by the interplay of secondary electron production by photon
interaction (including low energy Auger electrons) and their ability to leave
the nanoparticle.

that for well-founded resource models, a smallest specification always exists
that only includes the footprints, and also present results for the
non-well-founded case. Finally, we use this theory of footprints to investigate
the conditions under which the footprints correspond to the smallest safe
states. We present a new model of RAM in which, unlike the standard model, the
footprints of every program correspond to the smallest safe states, and we also
identify a general condition on the primitive commands of a programming

focus is the `old' cosmological constant problem, though the more recent

defined, including the closely related ideas of technical naturalness and `t
Hooft naturalness, and it is shown why these naturally arise when cosmology is
embedded within a framework --- effective field theories --- that efficiently
captures what is consistent with what is known about the physics of smaller
distances. Some care is taken to clarify conceptual issues, such as the
relevance or not of quadratic divergences, about which some confusion has
arisen over the years. A set of minimal criteria are formulated against which
proposed solutions to the problem can be judged, and a brief overview made of
the general limitations of most of the approaches. A somewhat more in-depth
discussion is provided of what I view as the most promising approach. These

depth on the muon induced background in a future dark matter experiment capable
of reaching the so-called neutrino floor. Our simulation study focuses on a
xenon-based detector with 71 tonnes of active mass, surrounded by additional
veto systems including an instrumented water shield. Two locations at the
Boulby Underground Laboratory (UK) served as a case study: an experimental
cavern in salt at a depth of 2850 m w.e. (similar to the location of the
existing laboratory), and a deeper laboratory located in polyhalite rock at a
depth of 3575 m w.e. Our results show that less than one event of cosmogenic
background is likely to survive standard analysis cuts for 10 years of
operation at either location. The largest background component that we
identified comes from delayed neutron emission from $^{17}$N which is produced

entanglement resources is considered, whereby two transmitters share
entanglement resources a priori before communication begins. Leditzky et al.
(2020) presented an example of a classical MAC, defined in terms of a pseudo
telepathy game, such that the sum rate with entangled transmitters is strictly
higher than the best achievable sum rate without such resources. Here, we
establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC
with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained
as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the
classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger
than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given
entanglement resources, the regions coincide. Furthermore, we address the
combined setting of entanglement resources and conferencing, where the
transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links.
Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate.

in many applications, ranging from wavelength division multiplexing and
switching to channel routing. Bandwidth tunable filters are capable of meeting
the on-demand flexible operations in complex situations, due to their
advantages of scalability, multi-function, and energy-saving. It has been
investigated recently that parity-time (PT) symmetry coupled-resonant systems
can be applied to the bandwidth-tunable filters. However, due to the trade-off
between the bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio and insertion loss of system, the
bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio of this method is severely limited. Here, the
bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio is defined as the maximum bandwidth divided by
the minimum bandwidth. In this work, we show that high bandwidth-tunable
contrast ratio and low insertion loss of system can be achieved simultaneously
by increasing the coupling strength between the input port and the resonant.
System characterizations under different coupling states reveal that the low
insertion loss can be obtained when the system initially operates at the
over-coupling condition. A high bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio PT-symmetry
band-pass filter with moderate insertion loss is shown on the Silicon platform.
Our scheme provides an effective method to reduce the insertion loss of on-chip
tunable filters, which is also applicable to the high-order cascaded microring
systems.

from an unconstrained lubricated to a constrained frictional state. Here, we
use numerical simulations to study the flow behavior and shear-induced
diffusion of frictional non-Brownian spheres in two dimensions under simple
shear flow. We first show that both viscosity $\eta$ and diffusivity
$D/\dot{\gamma}$ of the particles increase at characteristic shear stress,
which is associated with lubrication to frictional transition. Subsequently, we
propose a one-to-one relation between viscosity and diffusivity using the
length scale $\xi$ associated with the size of collective motions (rigid
clusters) of the particles. We demonstrate that $\eta$ and $D/\dot{\gamma}$ are
controlled by $\xi$ in two distinct flow regimes, i.e. in the frictionless and
frictional states, where the one-to-one relation is described as a crossover
from $D/\dot{\gamma}\sim\eta$ ({frictionless}) to $\eta^{1/3}$ ({frictional}).
We also confirm the proposed power laws are insensitive to the interparticle

predictions of this model, including the quantum corrections of dark Higgs
coupling constants and the uncertainty in estimation of the reheating

general learning methods, and its deployment means that it will return a
deterministic or random response for a given input query. An
information-laundered model consists of probabilistic components that
deliberately maneuver the intended input and output for queries to the model,
so the model's adversarial acquisition is less likely. Under the proposed

treated as disturbance for the UAV. In the dynamic model, the disturbance is
affected by the variable inertia parameters of the aerial manipulator system.

size-luminosity relation with optical luminosities above $10^{45}~{\rm
erg~s^{-1}}$. PG~0923+201 is for the first time monitored, and PG~1001+291 was
previously monitored but our campaign has a much longer temporal baseline. We
detect time lags of variations of the broad H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, Fe {\sc ii}
lines with respect to those of the 5100~{\AA} continuum. The velocity-resolved
delay map of H$\beta$ in PG~0923+201 indicates a complicated structure with a
mix of Keplerian disk-like motion and outflow, and the map of H$\beta$ in
PG~1001+291 shows a signature of Keplerian disk-like motion. Assuming a virial
factor of $f_{\rm BLR}=1$ and FWHM line widths, we measure the black hole mass
to be $118_{-16}^{+11}\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ for PG~0923+201 and
$3.33_{-0.54}^{+0.62}\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ for PG~1001+291. Their respective
accretion rates are estimated to be $0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.06} \times L_{\rm
Edd}\,c^{-2}$ and $679_{-227}^{+259}\times L_{\rm Edd}\,c^{-2}$, indicating
that PG~0923+201 is a sub-Eddington accretor and PG~1001+291 is a
super-Eddington accretor. While the H$\beta$ time lag of PG~0923+201 agrees
with the size-luminosity relation, the time lag of PG~1001+291 shows a
significant deviation, confirming that in high-luminosity AGN the BLR size
depends on both luminosity and Eddington ratio. Black hole mass estimates from
single AGN spectra will be over-estimated at high luminosities and redshifts if
this effect is not taken into account.

fluctuations have been compiled for relativistic heavy-ion collisions from the
available experimental data at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN and also
by the use of an event generator. Multiplicity fluctuations are sensitive to
QCD phase transition and to the presence of critical point in the QCD phase
diagram. In addition, multiplicity fluctuations provide baselines for other
event-by-event measurements. Multiplicity fluctuation expressed in terms of the
scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution is an intensive quantity, but
is sensitive to the volume fluctuation of the system. The importance of the
choice of narrow centrality bins and the corrections of centrality bin width
effect for controlling volume fluctuations have been discussed. It is observed
that the mean and width of the multiplicity distributions monotonically
increase as a function of increasing centrality at all collision energies,
whereas the multiplicity fluctuations show minimal variations with centrality.
The beam energy dependence shows that the multiplicity fluctuations have a slow
rise at lower collision energies and remain constant at higher energies.

mutually exclusive, each having its own strengths and limitations- the former
providing high homogeneity and coherence, and the latter offering the
advantages of robust optical waveguides. Here we present a hybrid platform that
does not rely on doping but rather on coating the waveguide - a tapered silica
optical fiber - with a monolayer of complexes, each containing a single RE ion.
The complexes offer an identical, tailored environment to each ion, thus
minimizing inhomogeneity and allowing tuning of their properties to the desired
application. Specifically, we use highly luminescent
Yb$^{+3}$[Zn(II)$_{MC}$(QXA)] complexes, which isolate the RE ion from the
environment and suppress non-radiative decay channels. We demonstrate that the
beneficial optical transitions of the Yb$^{+3}$ are retained after deposition
on the tapered fiber, and observe an excited-state lifetime of over 0.9 ms, on

Spicules are an important feature of the chromosphere, connecting the
photosphere to the corona, potentially mediating the transfer of energy and
mass. The aim of this work is to study the properties of spicules over
different regions of the sun. Our goal is to investigate if there is more than
one type of spicules, and how spicules behave in the quiet sun, coronal holes,
and active regions. We make use of high-cadence and high-spatial resolution Ca
II H observations taken by Hinode/SOT. Making use of a semi-automated detection
algorithm, we self-consistently track and measure the properties of 519
spicules over different regions. We find clear evidence of two types of
spicules. Type I spicules show a rise and fall and have typical lifetimes of
150-400 s and maximum ascending velocities of 15-40 km/s, while type II
spicules have shorter lifetimes of 50-150 s, faster velocities of 30-110 km/s,
and are not seen to fall down, but rather fade at around their maximum length.
Type II spicules are the most common, seen in quiet sun and coronal holes. Type
I spicules are seen mostly in active regions. There are regional differences
between quiet sun and coronal hole spicules, likely attributable to the
different field configurations. The properties of type II spicules are
consistent with published results of Rapid Blueshifted Events (RBEs),
supporting the hypothesis that RBEs are their disk counterparts. For type I
spicules we find the relations between their properties to be consistent with a
magnetoacoustic shock wave driver, and with dynamic fibrils as their disk
counterpart. The driver of type II spicules remains unclear from limb
observations.

the conditional uniqueness of multi-bubble solutions in the case where the

excel at recovering the overall face shape, they commonly miss subtle, extreme,
asymmetric, or rarely observed expressions. We improve upon these methods with
SMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics), which
faithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key
limitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training
formulation, and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For
training, most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted
face mesh with the input image, along with a plethora of additional loss
functions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide
supervision to optimize for 3D face geometry, camera, albedo, and lighting,
which is an ill-posed optimization problem, but the domain gap between
rendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead, SMIRK
replaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that,
given the rendered predicted mesh geometry, and sparsely sampled pixels of the
input image, generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color
information from sampled image pixels, supervising with neural rendering-based
reconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further, it enables us to
generate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training.
These are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as
supervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training
data and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative,
quantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK
achieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression
reconstruction. Project webpage: https://georgeretsi.github.io/smirk/.

we work within the construct of a minimal model with gauge-extended sector U

algorithm (called GAITA) for solution to this problem. Different from the
classical iterative thresholding algorithms using the Jacobi updating rule,
GAITA takes advantage of the Gauss-Seidel rule to update the coordinate
coefficients. Under a mild condition, we can justify that the support set and
sign of an arbitrary sequence generated by GAITA will converge within finite
iterations. This convergence property together with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz
property of ($l_q$LS) naturally yields the strong convergence of GAITA under
the same condition as above, which is generally weaker than the condition for
the convergence of the classical iterative thresholding algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GAITA converges to a local minimizer under
certain additional conditions. A set of numerical experiments are provided to
show the effectiveness, particularly, much faster convergence of GAITA as
compared with the classical iterative thresholding algorithms.

is present at a site then that particle dies with rate 1 but if both species
are present then the death rate is reduced to $\mu \le 1$ for each particle at
that site. We show the critical birth rate $\lambda_c(\mu)$ for weak survival

when $\mu < 1/2$ there is a discontinuous transition as $\lambda$ is varied. In

singlet-doublet (SD) Majorana fermion dark matter (DM) model where the required
correction to W boson mass arises from radiative corrections induced by SD
fermions. While a single generation of SD fermions, odd under an unbroken $Z_2$
symmetry, can not explain the W boson mass anomaly while being consistent with
DM phenomenology, two generations of SD fermions can do so with the heavier
generation playing the dominant role in W-mass correction and lighter
generation playing the role in DM phenomenology. Additionally, such multiple
generations of SD fermions can also generate light neutrino masses radiatively
if a $Z_2$-odd singlet scalar is included.

theability from any initial configuration that contains at least 5 robots to
form any general pattern (and not justpatterns that satisfy symmetricity
predicates). Our proposal also gets rid of the previous assumption (in thesame
model) that robots do not pause while moving (so, our robots really are fully
asynchronous), and theamount of randomness is kept low -- a single random bit
per robot per Look-Compute-Move cycle is used.Our protocol consists in the
combination of two phases, a probabilistic leader election phase, and a
deterministicpattern formation one. As the deterministic phase does not use
chirality, it may be of independentinterest in the deterministic context. A
noteworthy feature of our algorithm is the ability to form patternswith
multiplicity points (except the gathering case due to impossibility results), a

a novel visual malware called PlaceRaider, which allows remote attackers to

completely opportunistic use of the camera on the phone and other sensors,
PlaceRaider constructs rich, three dimensional models of indoor environments.

empirical assessment of TanDEM-X elevation data against high-resolution ground
truth illustrates that the quality of the DEM decreases in urban areas because
of SAR-inherent imaging properties. One possible solution for an enhancement of
the TanDEM-X DEM quality is to fuse it with other elevation data derived from
high-resolution optical stereoscopic imagery, such as that provided by the
Cartosat-1 mission. This is usually done by Weighted Averaging (WA) of

a method to efficiently predict weight maps in order to achieve optimized

automatically learn the pattern of the relationship between height errors and

improves the qualities of the study DEMs. Apart from increasing the absolute

Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) in the objective. The major difficulty in
these problems arises from time-inconsistency, which prevents us from directly
using dynamic programming. To resolve this challenge, we convert to an
equivalent bilevel optimization problem in which the inner optimization problem
is standard stochastic control. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which
the outer objective function is convex and differentiable. We compute the outer
objective's value via a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and its gradient via
the viscosity solution of a linear parabolic equation, which allows us to
perform gradient descent. The significance of this result is that we provide an
efficient dynamic programming-based algorithm for optimal control of CVaR
without lifting the state-space. To broaden the applicability of the proposed
algorithm, we propose convergent approximation schemes in cases where our key
assumptions do not hold and characterize relevant suboptimality bounds. In
addition, we extend our method to a more general class of risk metrics, which
includes mean-variance and median-deviation. We also demonstrate a concrete
application to portfolio optimization under CVaR constraints. Our results

The reconnection event occurred between the threads of a twisted arch filament

the twisted AFS drives some of its threads to encounter the coronal loops,
providing inflows of the reconnection. The reconnection is evidenced by flared
X-shape features in the AIA images, a current-sheet-like feature apparently
connecting post-reconnection loops in the \halpha$+$1 \AA\ images, small-scale
magnetic cancellation in the HMI magnetograms and flows with speeds of 40--80
km/s along the coronal loops. The post-reconnection coronal loops seen in AIA
94 \AA\ passband appear to remain bright for a relatively long time, suggesting
that they have been heated and/or filled up by dense plasmas previously stored
in the AFS threads. Our observations suggest that the twisted magnetic system
could release its free magnetic energy into the upper solar atmosphere through
reconnection processes. While the plasma pressure in the reconnecting flux
tubes are significantly different, the reconfiguration of field lines could
result in transferring of mass among them and induce heating therein.

degree of interaction between customer and agent. For instance, every
interaction features some number of contributions by each of the two sides,
creating a spectrum of interdependence. Additionally, each interaction is
further characterized by the pacing of these contributions, implying a spectrum
of synchronicity. Where a service falls on such spectra can simply be a
consequence of its design, but it can also be a function of its state. As
broadly evidenced empirically, an agent with several concurrent interactions
will be slowed in each individual interaction, altering the service's
synchronicity. Here, we study a Hawkes cluster model of the customer-agent
interaction, which we show captures both of these service (a)symmetries. We
find insightful connections to behavioral operations, such as proving the
occurrence of non-monotonic performance (e.g., inverted-U throughput) from
concurrency-driven asynchrony. Hence, we can prescribe the agent's optimal
concurrency level. Furthermore, we show how the service design dictates the
efficacy of these operational improvements, proving that the
concurrency-optimized throughput is itself non-monotonic as a function of the
interdependence. In what may be of independent interest methodologically, we
establish an interpretable decomposition for Hawkes clusters via probabilistic
combinatorics.

particular pixel. These approaches deliver competitive performance in usual
closed-set setups. However, important applications in the wild typically
require strong performance in presence of outliers. We show that this demanding
setup greatly benefit from mask-level predictions, even in the case of
non-finetuned baseline models. Moreover, we propose an alternative formulation
of dense recognition uncertainty that effectively reduces false positive
responses at semantic borders. The proposed formulation produces a further
improvement over a very strong baseline and sets the new state of the art in
outlier-aware semantic segmentation with and without training on negative data.
Our contributions also lead to performance improvement in a recent panoptic
setup. In-depth experiments confirm that our approach succeeds due to implicit
aggregation of pixel-level cues into mask-level predictions.

in 1+1 dimensions, using recovery operations that attempt to reconstruct the
density matrix in some region from its reduced density matrices on smaller
subregions. We use an explicit recovery channel known as the twirled Petz map,
and study distance measures such as the fidelity, relative entropy, and trace
distance between the original state and the recovered state. One setup we study
in detail involves three contiguous intervals $A$, $B$ and $C$ on a spatial
slice, where we can view these quantities as measuring correlations between $A$
and $C$ that are not mediated by the region $B$ that lies between them. We show
that each of the distance measures is both UV finite and independent of the
operator content of the CFT, and hence depends only on the central charge and
the cross-ratio of the intervals. We evaluate these universal quantities
numerically using lattice simulations in critical spin chain models, and derive
their analytic forms in the limit where $A$ and $C$ are close using the OPE
expansion. In the case where $A$ and $C$ are far apart, we find a surprising
non-commutativity of the replica trick with the OPE limit. For all values of
the cross-ratio, the fidelity is strictly better than a general
information-theoretic lower bound in terms of the conditional mutual
information. We also compare the mutual information between various subsystems
in the original and recovered states, which leads to a more qualitative
understanding of the differences between them. Further, we introduce
generalizations of the recovery operation to more than three adjacent
intervals, for which the fidelity is again universal with respect to the
operator content.

spectra of isotropic turbulence are computed using the EDQNM model and compared
to results of the multifractal formalism. At the highest Reynolds number
available in windtunnel experiments, $R_\lambda=2500$, both the multifractal
model and EDQNM give power-law corrections to the inertial range scaling of the
velocity increment skewness. For EDQNM, this correction is a finite Reynolds
number effect, whereas for the multifractal formalism it is an intermittency
correction that persists at any high Reynolds number. Furthermore, the two
approaches yield realistic behavior of second and third order statistics of the
velocity fluctuations in the dissipative and near-dissipative ranges.
Similarities and differences are highlighted, in particular the Reynolds number
dependence.

spherically symmetric collapse of inhomogeneous dust in presence of a
cosmological term, i.e., exact interior solutions of the Einstein field
equations is presented for the HD Tolman-Bondi metrics imbedded in a de Sitter
background. The solution is then matched to exterior HD Scwarschild-de Sitter.
A brief discussion on the causal structure singularities and horizons is
provided. It turns out that the collapse proceed in the same way as in the
Minkowski background, i.e., the strong curvature naked singularities form and
that the higher dimensions seem to favor black holes rather than naked
singularities.

inequality has been influential in obtaining several other matrix inequalities,
including numerical radius and norm results. Among many other results, we show
